horrifying than the death of an Israeli child.\u201d Williamson\u2019s position reflects the views of majority of Democrats.","390":"December poll from the New York Times and Siena College found 64 percent of Democratic voters felt Israel should stop its military campaign to prevent civilian casualties, even if Hamas had not been \u201celiminated\u201d.","391":"\u201cThe way Israel is prosecuting this war, with US support, is causing massive death and suffering among Palestinian civilians and is inconsistent with international norms and laws,\u201d Benoit added.","392":"Israel has continued to bomb Gaza for nearly 80 days, with more than 200 people killed in the past 24 hours.","393":"Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said the death toll since the start of the attacks rose to 20,258

severe damage to national assets and result in unacceptable numbers of civilian casualties on both sides; they have since confined their confrontations to limited tit-for-tat attacks that result in

deaths of 66 Palestinian journalists since October 7 when the Israeli assault began.","404":"More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since.","405":"The other journalists named in the RSF

massacre of journalists in Gaza and the targeting to which they seem to be subjected, we call on ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to clearly state that he is making it priority to elucidate the crimes committed against journalists in Gaza and to prosecute those responsible,\u201d RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in the statement.","411":"The Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Friday that 20,057 Palestinians have been killed and 53,320 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7, when the current conflict broke out.","412":"The death toll from Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel stands

after brief truce.","416":"On Friday, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 20,057 Palestinians have been killed and 53,320 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7, when the current conflict broke out.","417":"\u201cIn effect, the US is voting for the continuation of the siege, for the continuation of the mass killings in the Gaza Strip.","418":"In the current, fourth phase, Israeli soldiers are making slow progress towards the centre of Gaza City, engaging in proper urban fighting.","419":"He made two very interesting observations on casualties.","420":"No training can prepare soldiers for the real conditions of fighting in narrow streets, being attacked from all sides including from above, and having to worry about tunnels as well.","421":"\u201cIn training soldier learns what, say hand grenade, is supposed to do and what its lethal range is.","422":"Until each fighter and each unit engaged gain that crucial experience, they will take higher casualties.","423":"The death of nine Israeli soldiers in single incident in Shujayea on December 12 is textbook example illustrating the general\u2019s warning.","424":"Two officers and two soldiers from the Golani Brigade, one of the Israeli army\u2019s most experienced units, were ambushed by Qassam Brigade fighters as they entered building.","425":"As second Israeli team tried to rescue their comrades, they too triggered IEDs and were then killed by crossfire from the building they were in and from the higher floors of the neighbouring one.","426":"While attackers in modern warfare can expect between three and five wounded for each soldier killed, the ratio in MOUT is probably twice as high.","427":"Extreme dangers of urban combat do not affect only soldiers.","428":"Civilians who are caught in the areas of house-to-house fighting also get killed \u2014 some by bombs from the air, others by soldiers on the ground.","429":"The Israeli air force has not shown much thought for sparing civilian lives when bombing Gaza; Most of the Palestinians killed, now more than 20,000, fell victim to aerial bombardment.","430":"For Israel, it might be acceptable to kill Palestinian civilians with imprecise bombing, but not Israeli soldiers.","431":"But Israel has already killed one of every eight of its combat casualties through imprecise bombing.","432":"On December 12 the military command admitted that of the 105 troops killed by that point \u2014 the current figure being 137 \u2014 20 were killed by \u201cfriendly fire\u201d and other incidents involving Israeli soldiers killing each other.","433":"Of those 20 soldiers, 13 died from Israeli air force bombs, either through mistaken identification and location of the troops or by bombs falling far away from the aiming point.","434":"The majority of those bomb casualties occurred in the earlier phases of the war when distances between troops and their enemy were still considerable.","435":"Such modest rate of movement might be deliberate, to minimise casualties.","436":"Another incident also demonstrated the extreme perils of urban warfare: On December 15 Israeli soldiers killed three Israeli captives who managed to escape and were trying to cross over to the very unit that machine-gunned them to death.","437":"Israel was shocked, as the civilians, for change, were Israeli civilians, not Palestinians who are regularly killed by armed Israeli soldiers and police.","438":"But how could soldiers shoot people who were so non-soldierlike?","439":"Even in the heat of battle killing of civilians, especially ones displaying intent to give themselves up may indicate several unwanted issues that mar the operational performance of any army.","440":"These include lack of proper training to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants; blatant disregard for the lives of the purported enemy showing intent to surrender; and extreme battle stress without psychological support for war-weary soldiers.","441":"Other possible factors include disregard by the higher command of the conditions on the battlefield and failure to rotate out of combat the units that may have been engaged in heavy fighting, especially if the unit suffered casualties; and failure of the chain of command or the appointment of commanders of character unfit to follow orders and take decisions.","442":"As Israeli forces pound the Gaza Strip, journalists are being killed at rate with no parallel in modern history, press freedom watchdog says.","443":"The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said on Thursday that 68 media workers have been killed in the 10 weeks of fighting \u2013 61 of them Palestinian, four Israeli and three Lebanese.","444":"Among them is Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abudaqa , who was killed in an Israeli drone strike last week while reporting from school in Khan Younis.","445":"\u201cMore journalists have been killed in the first 10 weeks of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in single country over an entire year,\u201d the CPJ said in statement.","446":"\u201cMore than half the deaths \u2013 37 \u2013 occurred during the first month of the war, making it the deadliest single month ever documented by CPJ since it began recording journalist fatalities in 1992,\u201d it added.","447":"The report drew attention to what CPJ called \u201can apparent pattern of targeting of journalists and their families by the Israeli military\u201d, noting that it had recorded at least one instance in which journalist was killed while wearing clearly marked press insignia with no fighting in the surrounding area.","448":"\u201cThe concentration of journalists killed in the Israel-Gaza war is unparalleled in CPJ\u2019s history and underscores how grave the situation is for press on the ground,\u201d CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg said.","449":"\u201cLocal Palestinian journalists continue to report from Gaza while living in fear for their lives.\u201d The concentration of journalists killed in Gaza outpaces that of other conflict zones, such as Ukraine, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, it said.","450":"The CPJ said Iraq was the only country to approach the current death toll in Gaza when in 2006, 56 journalists were killed in the wake of the United States invasion of the Gulf country three years earlier.","451":"Another Al Jazeera journalist, Wael Dahdouh , lost his wife, son, daughter and grandson in an Israeli bombing last month and was wounded in the attack that killed Abudaqa.","452":"Al Jazeera has said it will refer Abudaqa\u2019s killing

diversity.","461":"Naturally, the question of unity arises when such bodies consider taking controversial political stance.","462":"As Israel began its latest assault on Gaza in October, and the civilian death toll began to mount at unprecedented speed with ample evidence of countless war crimes and crimes against humanity under way, Palestinian unions appealed directly to the global labour movement for support in ending the conflict.","463":"How do you square mourning those who were crushed to death or left to suffocate in collapsed mines, but not the thousands of children in Palestine who were crushed to death or left to suffocate under their collapsed homes \u2013 homes that were reduced to rubble by US munitions?","464":"It has left most of the besieged enclave unhabitable,

destroy Palestinians without any restraint or pretence.","479":"Israel\u2019s genocidal behaviour in Gaza and elsewhere in historic Palestine resonates with patterns seen in the Stanford prison experiment and the Milgram obedience study.","480":"The United Kingdom anti-Islamophobia organisation Tell MAMA has received sevenfold increase in reports of Islamophobia since October 7, when Hamas

elaborated on the issue in his 1979 book The Question of Palestine, noting that Israeli children\u2019s literature \u201cis made up of valiant Jews who always end up by killing low, treacherous Arabs, with names like Mastoul (crazy), Bandura (tomato), or Bukra (tomorrow).","882":"As writer for Haaretz said on September 20, 1974, \u201cchildren\u2019s books \u2018deal with our topic: the Arab who

Palestinians are still represented as evil \u201cOthers\u201d, and Israelis as innocent victims of history and circumstance.","887":"\u201cThey received the comparison between Sabra and Shatila

that has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians since October 7?","970":"The idea to envision additional powers for the secretary-general to potentially break deadlock was adopted as result of the Korean War in 1950, which saw North Korea invade its southern neighbour after years of hostilities between the two countries.","971":"It led to yet another deadlock in efforts to stop Israel\u2019s ground and air assaults that have killed nearly 18,000 Palestinians since the October 7 Hamas attack that killed over 1,100 people in Israel.","972":"The US believes its own political interventions would be more effective in trying to ensure that Israel avoids civilian deaths while doing its best to secure the release of captives held in Gaza and making strides towards Western-backed goal of

have been killed and 49,500 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7.","987":"After the perimeter of Gaza City was taken, Israeli sources leaked that some field commanders felt the price in soldiers and equipment was lower than expected with 104 combat casualties so far.","988":"It is impossible to determine whether the heavy civilian casualties and destruction of Palestinian infrastructure were collateral damage or part of the battle plan.","989":"Israeli casualty updates give insight into the fighting by comparing numbers of soldiers killed with the type, duration and reach of their advances.","990":"So Hamas fighters do not seem to be popping out of tunnel shafts and immediately targeting Israeli soldiers.","991":"But after two incidents early in the fighting in which four special forces soldiers in one instance and two engineering troops in another were killed by booby traps as they tried to enter tunnels, the initial reluctance may have turned into staunch unwillingness to commit soldiers to underground combat.","992":"With nearly all hostages now Israelis, some with dual US citizenship, it is hard to envisage that any Israeli politician or military

all members of the military.","1081":"Israel is trying to fend off accusations of indiscriminately killing civilians, but its claims make little sense.","1082":"Earlier this week at briefing in Israel, an official said that Hamas fighter was killed for every two civilians, suggesting that this was better combatant-to-civilian kill ratio than most armies in recent wars.","1083":"With nearly 17,400 people dead, it would imply that Hamas has suffered 5,800 combat deaths, ratio of more than 62 killed for each Israeli soldier lost in battle.","1084":"Even allowing for hypothetical and highly unrealistic possibility that half of them were killed while out of combat, in bed or in the streets, it would still mean that the Israeli military killed 2,900 enemies while suffering only 93 deaths in action.","1085":"In military terms, the ratio of more than 31 enemy soldiers killed for one combat death indicates significant defeat, rout even.","1086":"To be sure, military formation can lose 30 soldiers in battle where just one enemy dies; usually, that battle is lost but not necessarily the war.","1087":"Gallant\u2019s claim was either an exaggeration or an optimistic attempt to boost his

have been women and children, while thousands of young men are now being rounded up, many of them stripped and taken to undisclosed locations.","1092":"The move was perceived as victory for Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups, which were fed up with the Israeli judicial system for not punishing Israeli officials, settlers and soldiers who were committing crimes in the occupied territories such as land theft and extrajudicial killings.","1093":"According to Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organisation that opposes illegal settlements in the West Bank, Palestinians harmed

Gaza.","1732":"\u201cWe must not wait until our fighters are killed.","1733":"\u201cWe actually expected more people to be arrested during these four days.\u201d The Qatar-mediated truce came after 51 days of relentless Israeli bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, which began on October 7, the day Hamas launched surprise attack on Israeli territory, killing about 1,200 people.","1734":"Israel has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since then, the majority of them women and children.","1735":"Many have complained of severe beatings while six Palestinian prisoners have died in Israeli custody.","1736":"Several videos have also emerged in recent weeks of Israeli soldiers beating, stepping on, abusing and humiliating detained Palestinians who have been blindfolded, cuffed and stripped either partially or entirely.","1737":"More people could die from disease than from bombings in the Gaza Strip if the health and sanitation systems are not repaired, the World

them.","1744":"Their efforts to provide quality journalism for their audiences only accentuated the shockingly poor performance of the US networks.","1745":"American TV channels made little effort to convey to their audiences Palestinian points of view and sentiments.","1746":"The tremendous time and effort American hosts and correspondents committed to sharing with their audiences the powerful emotions of the families of Israeli detainees was impressive by any standard.","1747":"Yet in covering perhaps the second most significant political\/military event in the century-long conflict between Zionism\/Israel and Arabism\/Palestine (after 1947\/48), one would have expected American news networks to offer their audiences facts, personalities, emotions and social realities from both sides.","1748":"The female Palestinian detainees, however, were mostly called just \u201cfemales\u201d or \u201cwomen\u201d \u2013 thus the audiences were not encouraged to see them as mothers, aunts, grandmothers and form emotional bonds with them.","1749":"The analysts\/commentators interviewed in the US by American networks provided extra layers of orientalist stereotyping of Palestinians and Arabs that offered little or no news value but pandered mainly to audiences\u2019 natural entertainment instincts, or the networks\u2019 jingoistic support of US policies in the region.","1750":"We even heard that FBI agents were in Israel to investigate possible Palestinian crimes against American citizens \u2013 of course, no attempt was made by the networks to question whether similar efforts were under way to investigate the many Israeli crimes against the Palestinians, including the killing of more than 14,000 people, some of whom also happen to be American citizens.","1751":"The most glaring shortcoming in the American television coverage of the recent events in Israel-Palestine was the almost total lack of any historical context that would have helped audiences make sense of the October 7 attack on Israel and everything that followed.","1752":"All media organisations, including the TV networks attempting to cover this century of conflict for American audiences, should aspire to practise better journalism and avoid as much as possible presenting entertainment and propaganda in their news broadcasts.","1753":"Accompanied by Netanyahu, the tech billionaire also visited

were killed, and called for the release of more than 200 people taken hostage.","3667":"But it also said there had been \"far too many deaths of innocent civilians and children\" since Israel began striking Gaza in response.","3668":"The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then - of whom more than 4,500 were children.","3669":"The motion, one of several proposed amendments to the King's Speech, condemned Hamas's \"horrific\" killings and hostage-taking, but urged the government to press all sides for \"an immediate ceasefire\".","3670":"Soldiers fired into the air to force those remaining inside to come out, Khader said.","3671":"As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with number Hamas members and killed them, the IDF said.","3672":"Israel's Army Radio reported that troops had not yet found any sign of any of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel, when 1,200 other people were killed.","3673":"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says this could be something like , as shelter for able-bodied fighters, or to shield military objective from attack.","3674":"The WHO had warned that evacuating patients would be \"death sentence\", given that the medical system was collapsing.","3675":"Doctors were unable to help one patient with burns, and had to just \"let him die\".","3676":"Dr Mokhallalati said six premature babies had died in recent days.","3677":"In any warzone, counting the dead is challenge As battles there intensify, the chaotic situation - with bombardment by Israeli forces, on-the-ground fighting, communications blackouts, fuel shortages and crumbling infrastructure - makes getting accurate information on the numbers of people who have died extremely demanding.","3678":"The Hamas-run health ministry is Gaza's official source for death numbers - which it updates regularly.","3679":"On Monday evening, it said 11,240 people had been killed, including 4,630 children, since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October which prompted the current war.","3680":"The number of those killed in the attacks in Israel, meanwhile, was initially put at 1,400 by Israeli authorities but was later revised down to about 1,200.","3681":"The health ministry in Gaza reports regular death total on social media, with an additional breakdown of the number of women, children and the elderly who have been killed.","3682":"The figures do not give the cause of death, but describe the dead as victims of \"Israeli aggression\".","3683":"Some of the bodies remain trapped under piles of rubble, says the Palestinian Red Crescent.","3684":"Health ministry officials say the death figures are recorded by medical professionals before being passed on to them and the figures only include people recorded dead in hospital.","3685":"The figures do not distinguish between military and civilian deaths.","3686":"And, because they do not take into account those who died at the scene of blasts whose bodies have not been found, or buried immediately, they may be an undercount, Gazan officials say.","3687":"That point was amplified by the Biden administration last week, when senior US official said the death toll was likely to be greater than the numbers being reported.","3688":"\"We think they're very high, frankly,\" Barbara Leaf, assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told House Foreign Affairs Committee, \"and it could be that they're even higher than are being cited.\" It stands in stark contrast to the view of Mr Biden himself, who, on 25 October, said he had \"no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed.\" However, he did not provide any evidence for his scepticism.","3689":"day after Mr Biden's dismissal of the numbers, the health ministry in Gaza provided more information, publishing an extensive list of names of all those who had been killed between 7 and 26 October.","3690":"We have also spoken to an independent research group, Airwars, which is in the process of matching deaths it has investigated to names on the health ministry's list, and the UN - which has assessed death figures in Gaza during previous periods of conflict.","3691":"He says the hospital morgue records deaths after confirming the identity of the dead person with their relatives.","3692":"The number of deaths registered so far, he believes, is far fewer than those that have actually occurred.","3693":"\"Most of the deaths happen at home,\" he says.","3694":"To examine the health ministry's list, the BBC cross-referenced names included on it with the names of dead people who had appeared in our reporting.","3695":"One of those deaths the BBC reported was Dr Midhat Mahmoud Saidam, who was killed in strike on 14 October.","3696":"Satellite imagery analysis carried out by the BBC showed damage to the area where he lived around the date of his death.","3697":"As part of its work investigating civilian deaths, it has matched names of the dead on the health ministry list with areas that have been bombed.","3698":"Its investigation also found 23 of his family members had also died and all were recorded on the health ministry list.","3699":"\"It is nearly impossible at the moment to provide any UN verification on day-to-day basis.\" Others who have scrutinised the health ministry's figures include economics professor Michael Spagat, from Royal Holloway, University of London - who chairs the charity Every Casualty Counts which studies death tolls in wars.","3700":"However, one discrepancy remains hotly contested - that of the death toll after blast at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on 17 October.","3701":"The health ministry said 500 people had been killed, and that figure was later revised down to 471.","3702":"Israel's military cited the al-Ahli figures as the basis for claim that the Gaza health ministry \"continuously inflates the number of civilian casualties.\" The BBC has made repeated attempts to contact the health ministry in Gaza, but has been unable to get response so far.","3703":"In an analysis of health ministry death figures from the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014, in which Gaza was bombed, and separate record of death figures from that same year collated by Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, Prof Spagat found overall consistency in the reported figures.","3704":"The ministry of health said 2,310 Gazans had been killed in 2014, while B'Tselem counted 2,185 deaths.","3705":"The UN said 2,251 Palestinians were killed, including 1,462 civilians and Israel's foreign ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians.","3706":"Discrepancies such as these are \"fairly normal\" says Prof Spagat, as some people may have died in hospital for reasons subsequently shown to be unrelated to violence in conflict.","3707":"Ola Awad-Shakhshir, president of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, receives regular updates of deaths from Gaza.","3708":"Ms Awad-Shakhshir says that Israel's interior ministry effectively controls ID numbers for newborn babies born in Gaza and the West Bank - the same ID numbers that appear on the Hamas-run health ministry's register of recorded deaths.","3709":"When the BBC approached spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces about why they have cast doubt on the Gazan death figures it said the health ministry was branch of Hamas and that any information provided by it should be \"viewed with caution\".","3710":"We also asked the Israeli prime minister's office about how the numbers of Israelis killed on 7 October by Hamas were recorded.","3711":"It did not answer that question, however in recent days Israel has revised down the number of people killed during the attack to about 1,200, from the earlier figure of 1,400.","3712":"Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the revised number was because many bodies were not immediately identified after the attack, and \"now we think those belong to terrorists...","3713":"not Israeli casualties\".","3714":"The Israeli government has not published detailed list of the civilian casualties although some Israeli media outlets have assembled such lists with names, ages and locations of deaths.","3715":"Israel's police says more than 850 bodies of civilians have been identified - work is continuing to try to identify remains using specialist forensic techniques.","3716":"There is public list of the Israeli soldiers killed so far that includes 48 who have died in the fighting inside Gaza.","3717":"On Saturday in Gaza's south,

Gaza in response.","3731":"The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then - of whom more than 4,500 were children.","3732":"The Oxford West and Abingdon

to be when we die?\" At least 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, when gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip.","3735":"Since then, more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza - 4,500 of them children - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","3736":"Forty-six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting inside Gaza over the same period, the Israel Defense Forces say.","3737":"They were calling for ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, which started on 7 October when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and

I've been there many times It has big grounds, so people in Gaza went there to seek shelter and camp out as they saw it as safe area It has now become symbol of the juxtaposition of the war - the Israeli invasion of Gaza inflicting masses of casualties and damage, set against the crisis of urgent humanitarian need inside the hospital.","3742":"At the same time, we have seen hardening of the international position around the Israeli offensive in the last few days with the US, the UK and France using language that is shifting the tone - perhaps summed up best by what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weekend: \"Far too many\" Palestinian civilians have been killed.","3743":"The other is diplomatic: how long does Israel hold legitimacy to carry out that operation before its allies say, \"you've killed enough people, civilians, you need to stop now please.\" Israel feels that because of the absolute enormity of the numbers of casualties in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, they have more time than usual, and think they have gone in - as we can see from the levels of casualties in Gaza - using great deal of force.","3744":"She said: \"Chanting all sorts of hateful

longer maintains the capacity to murder, abuse and just do horrific things\" to Israel, the president said.","3779":"Mr Miller suggests it would more likely take an external event, such as the unconditional release of all the hostages held by Hamas, or single Israeli operation that results in mass Palestinian casualties, although the bar has been set quite high.","3780":"\"In the last Gaza war we brought people together and, after that session, the thing that hit me the strongest was simple point - both sides wanted peace.\" About 240 people were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen during the

Israeli civilians, it has said reaching the hospital is one of its main targets.","3797":"Israel's major justification for killing so many people in Gaza - more than 11,500 in more than month, according to the latest figure from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry - is that Hamas was using them as human shields.","3798":"This video can not be played Israel \"not successful\" at minimising casualties but Hamas to blame - Netanyahu Negotiations are ongoing with Qatar to try to reach some sort of deal to recover the more than 200 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas inside Gaza.","3799":"So many civilians have been killed by Israel in Gaza in the last 42 days that concern is growing about Israel's methods in the United States - which is the only international power the Israelis really worry about.","3800":"And another interesting development is the publication by what's called the \"Elders\", group of retired prime ministers, presidents and elder statesmen and women
