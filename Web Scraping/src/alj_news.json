The system is effective, as the United Kingdom, Russia, Malta, and many other countries saved by convoys in World War II can attest.", "But every strategy has its limitations.

Whatever the protective measures taken, huge tankers and container carriers \u2013 longer than 300 metres (984 feet) \u2013 still present big targets.

The attack, probably planned to test the Houthis\u2019 attack doctrine and enemy response, lasted nine hours, forcing the crew of the target ship to maintain full readiness and concentration for a prolonged period to intercept all incoming missiles.", "Every admiral would tell his political superiors that military necessity would call for attacks on Houthi missile infrastructure on the ground in Yemen: fixed and mobile launch sites, production and storage facilities, command centres and whatever little radar infrastructure there exists. A proactive response to the missile threat, in other words, to destroy the Houthi ship-targeting capability, rather than the reactive one limited to shooting missiles down as they come in.", "In theory, attacks against Houthi missile infrastructure could be based on satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reconnaissance and carried out by missiles launched from the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and armed drones from distant land bases. But the only realistic chance at meaningful success would require the use of combat aircraft, bombers based on the two US Navy nuclear carriers in the region.", "Attacks against targets in Yemen would have a clear military justification. But they would also carry a clear political risk: that of the West, particularly the US, being seen in the Arab and Islamic world as actually entering the Gaza war on the side of Israel.

But when their repeated attacks on ships headed to and from the Suez Canal threatened the security of international maritime routes, the US was forced to act.", "The US Navy already has a huge number of ships in the region, so why would it need to ask friendly nations to contribute more?", "One reason is that even with such a large force, the US cannot spare many ships for the task. The other is political unwillingness to be the only nation attacking Yemen as it would likely be interpreted, especially in the Middle East, as direct military action in aid of Israel.", "US political and military dilemmas are largely conditioned by geography and Yemen\u2019s control of the strategically important choke point where the Indian Ocean funnels into the Red Sea. The Bab el-Mandeb passage is only 29km (16 nautical miles) wide at its narrowest point.", "Its approaches are bristling with warships: More than 35 from at least 12 nations that do not border the Red Sea are now in positions from which they could reach the strait in less than 24 hours. Nations along its African and Arabian shores have at least as many in their harbours.", "Many of these ships were already in the region before 7 October.

Somali pirates venture out to sea in fast small boats, armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades and intercept commercial shipping heading towards and from Bab el-Mandeb in three directions: from the Far East, passing south of India; from the Gulf, sailing around the Arabian Peninsula; and north to south along African shores.", "Shipping companies demanded protection and the international community, aware of the need to keep shipping lanes open and secure, provided it. Every month, 200 ships cross the Suez in each direction carrying no less than 3 million containers.", "Since 1990, the Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150) had been engaged in anti-piracy missions.

The US and Iran exchanged indirect statements, assuring each other they did not seek confrontation. Iran announced that it had not been informed of the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, and the US did everything to avoid alienating Iran. In return, Tehran nudged the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah into refraining from a full-scale offensive. The de-escalation seemed to be working.", "But then the Houthis, considered to be an Iranian proxy in much the same way as Hezbollah, decided to attack in the Red Sea, demanding Israel end its war on Gaza. They launched long-range missiles at Israel and naval missiles at US Navy destroyers that had entered the Red Sea.", "Both operations failed, with all missiles and drones being on several occasions intercepted and shot down. The US Navy was convinced that its two destroyers could handle the situation, possibly being reinforced in time by a couple more.", "But when tankers and container ships in the Red Sea started taking hits almost daily, the escalation was undeniable. Many of the world\u2019s biggest shipping companies shifted from going through the Suez Canal to the longer and more expensive route around Africa. Commercial carriers now introduced a $700 surcharge on each container sailing the longer route.", "Counting just those laden with Asian manufactured goods heading to Europe, the additional cost is a staggering $2bn per month. That increase gets passed on to the final customers \u2013 leading to inflation. In addition, the longer travel will soon cause distribution delays, shortages and general disruption of the economy, which every nation will feel.", "The ", "markets demanded action", " and the US optimistically believed it could assemble a robust force of up to 20 participating nations to carry out Operation Prosperity Guardian.

Refusals also came from major Arab navies straddling Red Sea shores: Saudi Arabia and Egypt. They hinted that they did not want to be seen engaging an Arab country in this situation.

Ansar Allah say they would stop these attacks only when Israel ends its genocidal siege and bombardment of the Palestinian enclave.", "These attacks are part of a coordinated military reaction by the three core Arab members of the Iran-led anti-Israel (and anti-West) \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d, Hezbollah, Hamas and Ansar Allah, to Israel\u2019s latest assault on the Palestinians.", "At one point last week, Israel and the United States simultaneously exchanged direct fire with Axis of Resistance forces in both Gaza and the West Bank in Palestine, in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and also Yemen \u2013 which can also be seen as a peculiar low-intensity, indirect military engagement with Iran.", "Any assessment of how the region has evolved since October 7, and what likely lies ahead, must acknowledge three critical points relating to the Axis of Resistance\u2019s regional network, military capabilities and trajectory.", "The mainstream US media and political elite tend to ignore all three points, which are:", "The widespread fear in the West that this latest Israel-Hamas confrontation would spark a full-fledged regional war between the US-Israel and half a dozen Arab-Iranian forces has not materialised. However, neither has the confrontation remained confined to Gaza \u2013 it has sparked the first serious coordinated battlefield action by the Axis of Resistance across the region. This reflects Hezbollah\u2019s talk all year of the \u201cunity of fronts\u201d, ie, Axis members now coordinate and assist one another in battle, or between battles, in times of preparation.", "For decades, Hezbollah and Hamas were the only two Arab powers that faced down Israel militarily, and forced it into ceasefires, prisoner exchanges and other concessions. Ansar Allah\u2019s ongoing drone and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping routes will likely similarly challenge Israel. These attacks may eventually provide the Yemeni group with important leverage against its Western adversaries, especially if, as expected, the US and Israel do not send ground troops into Yemen, but rely solely on air power in their efforts to protect trade routes.", "Hezbollah was the first Axis member to prove its military prowess against Israel. The impasse between the Lebanon-based group and Israel in the 2006 war led to an informal truce based on mutual deterrence. Both parties realised that a fully-fledged war would inflict severe damage to national assets and result in unacceptable numbers of civilian casualties on both sides; they have since confined their confrontations to limited tit-for-tat attacks that result in limited casualties. On October 7, by attacking Israel at an unprecedented scale and then managing to defend its assets to date, Hamas has also proved that it has built significant military prowess. Ansar Allah\u2019s capabilities are also improving \u2013 after forcing Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into ending their war on Yemen, in the past month it attacked at least 100 vessels in the Red Sea with high efficiency.

Former American diplomat in Yemen Dr Nabeel Khoury, now a senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington, also explained to me in an interview that after the end of the war in Yemen, Ansar Allah now seem ready to act on a regional level.", "Yet you would be ignorant of this if your knowledge about the region comes from the mainstream US media.

{"title": "Analysis: Why is Israel\u2019s military killing so many of its own?", "body": ["The Israeli army\u2019s reaction to the Hamas attacks of October 7 has so far gone through four distinct phases.", "The first, which started within hours of the incursion into the territory of Israel, was mostly aerial bombardment as revenge and preparation for next steps. The second phase saw the infantry and artillery enter the northern areas of the Gaza Strip from three directions, advancing towards Gaza City to cut it off from the remainder of the Palestinian territory.", "In the third phase, Israel\u2019s army completed the encirclement at the fringes of the city, making some limited advances, probes towards the centre. In the current, fourth phase, Israeli soldiers are making slow progress towards the centre of Gaza City, engaging in proper urban fighting.", "Having accomplished the blockade of the largest city in the north, Israel has repeated the same staged approach in the centre, and fighting in ", "Khan Younis", " is now also in phase four.", "So far, fighting has been limited to conventional ground combat, with both sides operating as analysts had expected. The ", "threat of tunnel warfare", " has not yet materialised.", "To confirm my assessments of the fighting so far \u2014 especially as I observe it from a distance \u2014 I spoke to a retired United States general with whom I spent time on the ground during intense urban fighting in Fallujah in Iraq in 2004. He shared my view of the dangers and difficulties of full-scale MOUT, the US abbreviation for \u201cmilitary operations in urban terrain\u201d that Israel is pursuing.", "He made two very interesting observations on casualties.", "First, the learning curve for the attackers is very steep, as expected. No training can prepare soldiers for the real conditions of fighting in narrow streets, being attacked from all sides including from above, and having to worry about tunnels as well.", "The general noted that \u201cmost efficient weapon in urban warfare is experience\u201d, explaining that every ordnance is designed for a certain imagined and ideal situation that never exists on the ground. \u201cIn training a soldier learns what, say a hand grenade, is supposed to do and what its lethal range is. But till he has thrown a few from one room to another, he cannot imagine the force of the blast or the distance that the shrapnel goes bouncing off concrete walls\u201d. Until each fighter and each unit engaged gain that crucial experience, they will take higher casualties.", "The ", "death of nine Israeli soldiers", " in a single incident in Shujayea on December 12 is a textbook example illustrating the general\u2019s warning. Two officers and two soldiers from the Golani Brigade, one of the Israeli army\u2019s most experienced units, were ambushed by Qassam Brigade fighters as they entered a building. An improvised explosive device (IED) blocked their exit route and Hamas fighters finished them off with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. As a second Israeli team tried to rescue their comrades, they too triggered IEDs and were then killed by crossfire from the building they were in and from the higher floors of the neighbouring one.", "The American general\u2019s second poignant warning regards the numbers. While attackers in modern warfare can expect between three and five wounded for each soldier killed, the ratio in MOUT is probably twice as high.", "Extreme dangers of urban combat do not affect only soldiers. Civilians who are caught in the areas of house-to-house fighting also get killed \u2014 some by bombs from the air, others by soldiers on the ground.", "The Israeli air force has not shown much thought for sparing civilian lives when bombing Gaza; Most of the Palestinians killed, now more than 20,000, fell victim to aerial bombardment.", "Israel admitted that 50 percent of the bombs used were \u201cdumb\u201d ones. They can only be aimed by pointing the aircraft before release and can stray 50-to-100 metres (164-328 feet) from their aiming point. For Israel, it might be acceptable to kill Palestinian civilians with imprecise bombing, but not Israeli soldiers.", "But Israel has already killed one of every eight of its combat casualties through imprecise bombing. On December 12 the military command admitted that of the 105 troops killed by that point \u2014 the current figure being 137 \u2014 20 were killed by \u201cfriendly fire\u201d and other incidents involving Israeli soldiers killing each other. Of those 20 soldiers, 13 died from Israeli air force bombs, either through mistaken identification and location of the troops or by bombs falling far away from the aiming point.", "The majority of those bomb casualties occurred in the earlier phases of the war when distances between troops and their enemy were still considerable. But in urban fighting foes are often 10 or 20 metres (33-66 feet) away, so the only acceptable way to support them is to use precisely guided smart bombs.", "The current Israeli rate of advance seems to be slow. Such a modest rate of movement might be deliberate, to minimise casualties. But if days ahead demonstrate an ease in the bombardment of the centres of Gaza City and Khan Younis, that might be a first sign that the Israeli air force is running out of smart bombs.", "Another incident also demonstrated the extreme perils of urban warfare: On December 15 Israeli soldiers killed three Israeli captives who managed to escape and were trying to cross over to the very unit that machine-gunned them to death.", "Israel was shocked, as the civilians, for a change, were Israeli civilians, not Palestinians who are regularly killed by armed Israeli soldiers and police. But how could soldiers shoot people who were so non-soldierlike?\u00a0 Shirtless, to show they had no weapons; in civilian trousers; carrying a makeshift white flag, a symbol of surrender and peace; and speaking in Hebrew?", "Under pressure from its stunned citizens, the Israeli military will certainly investigate all circumstances in detail, but some things are clear.", "Even in the heat of battle killing of civilians, especially ones displaying intent to give themselves up may indicate several unwanted issues that mar the operational performance of any army. These include a lack of proper training to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants; blatant disregard for the lives of the purported enemy showing intent to surrender; and extreme battle stress without psychological support for war-weary soldiers.", "Other possible factors include disregard by the higher command of the conditions on the battlefield and a failure to rotate out of combat the units that may have been engaged in heavy fighting, especially if the unit suffered casualties; and failure of the chain of command or the appointment of commanders of a character unfit to follow orders and take decisions.", "Aside from Hamas, the Israeli military clearly has issues within its ranks to deal with. At the same time, it seems unsure how much it can count on support from their Prime Minister. There are signs that many higher officers distrust Benyamin Netanyahu and would rather have in his place someone who would show more respect for the military than for his own political goals.", "They won\u2019t admit it, but another ceasefire might be the respite that Israel\u2019s military needs."], "subhead": "The perils of urban warfare, coupled with operational issues within the army, appear to be hobbling Israel\u2019s advance.", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/why-is-israels-military-killing-so-many-of-its-own"},

First, nine soldiers were killed in a single operation in the Shujaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City on Tuesday. That shock was followed by another one on Friday, with the Israeli army admitting that it ", "killed three Israeli captives", ", having mistaken them for enemies \u2013 even though they held white flags.", "So what is really happening on the ground in Gaza?", "Nothing we did not predict weeks ago: The war has entered a difficult, unpredictable and bloody phase of full-scale urban warfare where gains are small and slow, and losses can be huge.", "Combat in narrow and cramped streets of old cities is known to be one of the most difficult ways to fight a war.

To do that, the first step is to control the ground where the enemy operates: the cities.", "Many aspects of warcraft are as ancient as the human urge to fight wars: attack and conquer versus defend and remain free. But the ways of achieving those goals have changed with technology and, at certain times, the means available to soldiers favour one aspect over another.", "In the old days, cities needed strong walls to defend themselves, but in the last 100 years, weapons have advanced at a rapid rate, causing a change in tactics. Successful resistance against enemy attacks no longer depends on huge, expensive static bastions. Nowadays, small but potent man-portable weapons whose destructive power is hugely disproportionate to their size, such as anti-tank rocket launchers, grenade throwers, small mortars, assault rifles and many others, allow the defenders to turn each house and every street into a formidable defensive position.", "From the 1940s to this day, almost all attempts to conquer cities held by determined defenders have ended in failure.

Now, as Israel continues to pulverise an already thoroughly pulverised territory, it seems the Israelis may be taking the concept of scorched earth policy to a whole new level.", "According to the Oxford Reference dictionary, the term \u201cscorched earth policy\u201d was first utilised in English in 1937 in a report describing the Sino-Japanese conflict, in which the Chinese levelled their own cities and burned crops in order to complicate the Japanese invasion. The strategy has since been seen in an array of armed conflicts worldwide, including the 36-year civil war in Guatemala that ended in 1996 after killing and disappearing more than 200,000 people, primarily Indigenous Mayans.", "In 2013, former Guatemalan dictator and United States buddy Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt \u2013 who oversaw a particularly bloody segment of the war in the early 1980s \u2013 was found ", "guilty of genocide", " in a Guatemalan court. And while subsequent judicial machinations and R\u00edos Montt\u2019s own death by heart attack saved the man from earthly atonement for his crimes, you might say the truth is not so easily wiped \u201coff the face of the earth\u201d.", "Indeed, scorched earth was a primary component of the Guatemalan army\u2019s genocidal approach to its adversaries, and hundreds of Indigenous villages were destroyed along with water supplies, crops, and anything else that might sustain life. And what do you know: Guatemalan state savagery was boosted by none other than the state of Israel, which after all already had several decades of experience in eradicating Indigenous life in Palestine \u2013 pardon, \u201cmaking the desert bloom\u201d.", "As journalist Gabriel Schivone notes in an article for the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA), not only did Israeli advisers help ensure the success of the 1982 military coup that brought R\u00edos Montt to power, but Israel also \u201cassisted every facet of attack on the Guatemalan people\u201d from the late 1970s into the next decade. For successive Guatemalan governments, Schivone writes, Israel had become the \u201cmain provider of counterinsurgency training, light and heavy arsenals of weaponry, aircraft, state-of-the-art intelligence technology and infrastructure, and other vital assistance\u201d.", "In keeping with the \u201cdesert-blooming\u201d variety of blasphemy, Israel was also credited with assisting Guatemala in agricultural endeavours during the civil war era \u2013 since there\u2019s clearly nothing better for agriculture than, you know, scorched earth.", "Meanwhile, in neighbouring El Salvador, the United States\u2019s supposedly existential fight against communism during the Cold War also enabled right-wing regimes to slaughter a whole lot of peasants. And like in Guatemala, Israel was standing by to offer a helping hand \u2013 including in the implementation of scorched earth policies.", "An ", "AJ+ video", " draws attention to the fact that Israel helped train ANSESAL, the Salvadoran intelligence agency that \u201cwould lay the foundation for death squads\u201d during El Salvador\u2019s own 12-year civil war, which killed at least 75,000 people and ended in 1992. According to the video, from 1975 until the start of the civil war in 1979, Israel was the source of a full 83 percent of El Salvador\u2019s military imports. The vast majority of wartime killings were perpetrated by the US-backed right-wing state and associated paramilitary groups.", "It goes without saying, of course, that scorched earth campaigns are deadly \u2013 and sometimes, that deadliness outlives the conflict itself. Take Vietnam, where the US military\u2019s quite literal scorching of the earth with the toxic defoliant ", "Agent Orange", " continued to cause miscarriages, birth defects, and severe illnesses decades after the official end of the Vietnam War in 1975.", "In Iraq", ", the US\u2019s use of depleted uranium munitions might also qualify as a scorched earth policy of sorts, as saturating a territory in radioactive poison doesn\u2019t do much to ensure its long-term habitability.", "Speaking of poisons, the Washington Post recently confirmed that the Israeli military fired US-supplied white phosphorus rounds at southern Lebanon in October despite the use of such weapons in civilian areas being \u201cgenerally prohibited under international humanitarian law\u201d. As per the Post\u2019s writeup, south Lebanese residents affected by the attack \u201cspeculated that the phosphorus was meant to displace them from the village and to clear the way for future Israeli military activity in the area\u201d.", "It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time \u2013 in Lebanon or in the Gaza Strip, which has seen its fair share of illegal white phosphorus bombardments by Israel.", "As the Israeli military now carries on scorching and re-scorching the earth in Gaza and the humans therein along with it, there is a singularity that distinguishes Israel\u2019s efforts from scorched earth experiments of the past.

Since October 7, the West Bank has been subjected to unprecedented military measures by Israeli forces. The only time such stringent measures have been seen before was perhaps during the first days of June 1967, the start of the Israeli occupation.", "Stringent curfews and clampdown measures implemented by armed settlers and Israeli forces on all cities, towns and camps in the West Bank have completely cut areas off from each other. Israeli forces have erected new military checkpoints and closed entrances and roads using iron gates and earth mounds. Meanwhile, Israeli settlers have ramped up harassment and attacks on Palestinian residents every day, throwing rocks and stones at Palestinian vehicles and shooting bullets at civilians who dare to leave their houses and step into their streets or fields \u2013 especially difficult during the olive season, which starts each year at the beginning of October and lasts until the end of November.", "Our home village of al-Lubban Ash-Sharqiya is 21km (13 miles) south of Nablus and 27km north of Ramallah.

Only one road remains, leading to the city of Salfit in the central West Bank.", "My youngest brother, Wajid, works as a photojournalist for the Palestinian Ministry of Information.", "He tells me: \u201cThe roads are very, very difficult around Ramallah. Every time I head out to check the status of barriers and closures, they are bad. One road may be passable but it is long and winding and passes through many villages before you can get to our village.", "\u201cSince the beginning of the war, I have seen the family only once, due to the difficult road conditions.

That was the only road which is paved and Israeli forces have now dug a trench stretching along it for 1.5km. The other access routes to the village are dirt tracks which have been created naturally by the village\u2019s positioning between a hill and a plain.", "There is one remaining route out of a neighbouring village towards Salfit, through which you can reach Ramallah. But this adds 20km to the journey and many people do not have the money to pay for the additional fuel.", "A few days ago, settlers stormed the girls\u2019 school in our village, tore down the Palestinian flag and raised the Israeli flag in its place.", "\u201cThe war has changed everything in the village,\u201d he tells me. One major issue is that children have been unable to go to school in the village since the start of the war.", "Yamen explains that the village schools, from the seventh grade and through secondary school, are located on the main Nablus-Ramallah Street, through which thousands of settlers pass daily. Israeli army jeeps are stationed at the gates of those schools from 6am. While the streets of the village used to be full of the comings and goings of schoolchildren, they are now almost empty. Some pupils have reported receiving threatening messages from settlers on social networking sites and are too afraid to go out. Other students have been injured by bullets and suffered fractures and bruises.", "\u201cIn the end, they [armed settlers] forcibly closed those schools with the army protecting them,\u201d he says. \u201cA few days ago, they stormed the girls\u2019 school, tore down the Palestinian flag and raised the Israeli flag in its place.", "\u201cWhen I walk in the neighbourhood, I listen to the girls and boys from the village schools talking about how much they wish they could get back to face-to-face education and to go back to school.\u201d", "The children are not the only ones missing from the streets of our home village.", "\u201cThe street outside resembles a military barracks, with nothing passing except for Israeli military vehicles, sometimes chasing and shooting at Arab cars trying to leave our village or the surrounding villages. I lived through the tunnel rampage in September 1996, during which violent confrontations continued for a week, and the second Intifada in September 2000 which continued until 2005. They were very violent years of confrontation, but not once did the street become completely empty of [civilian] vehicles like this. This is a new level of fear and caution.\u201d Yamen says.", "It is particularly unusual for the village to be so quiet at this time of year, during olive season. \u201cThere is usually a lot of movement of people back and forth to their lands to pick olives,\u201d says Yamen.", "He explains that about 40 percent of the trees are located in areas that have become very difficult to reach because of the threats from armed settlers and soldiers, who have been shooting at the farmers. Some have ventured out, unwilling to let the harvest go to waste, but say that settlers and soldiers have stolen their crops.", "\u201cMore than 1,500kg of olives have been stolen here,\u201d Yamen tells me. \u201cThat is worth $3,000. And, more than 4,000 trees remain unharvested \u2013 there are entire families that depend on producing olive oil to make ends meet. This is a loss amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d", "And then there is me, their eldest brother. I remain stuck in the city of Nablus, along with my children who were longing to get to the village for the farming season.", "I would like to attempt to go to the countryside but the checkpoints, harassment and likelihood of attacks by settlers make it impossible. Today and every day, my children, Julia and Amin, just wait for the war to end and for the roads to open again.", "My children love the wilderness of the village, its mountains, plains and seasons. Julia wants to pick daffodils and take pictures and videos of the land. She says the army has stopped her from going to the land and chasing small insects and butterflies. Amin especially misses the tea made on firewood, a tradition in the village during the olive season. He wanted to film the wood smoke and the teapot boiling over on his phone, as he did last year.", "They tell me: \u201cWe want to go to milk, even if we have exams.\u201d", "The thing that upsets them most is that the family has lost their olives this year.", "I never imagined being away from my family for this long, especially since I had not visited them for two months before that.

After all, since the beginning of this latest war, mainstream US media have eagerly justified and excused Israel\u2019s atrocities against Palestinians. For example, they usually refer to blatant acts of ethnic cleansing and forced displacement in Gaza as \u201cevacuations\u201d, and claim Israel is \u201cdefending itself\u201d against \u201cterror\u201d even as it continues to terrorise millions of civilians living under its occupation with bombs and bullets along with apartheid laws and settler-colonial policies of oppression.", "Like its refusal to acknowledge Israel\u2019s other atrocities against Palestinians and violations of international law, the US media\u2019s reluctance to report on and discuss the accusations of genocide has real consequences.", "As Prism, a progressive news outlet based in the US, recently noted, \u201cthrough journalistic sleight of hand \u2013 including the use of passive language, ever-shifting headlines, bothsidesism, and the myth of objectivity \u2013 reporters across the US are fuelling the genocide their newsrooms are refusing to acknowledge is taking place\u201d.", "Indeed, what constitutes genocide is clearly defined in the 1948 Genocide Convention, and this is exactly what we witness in Palestine today.

Then on November 3, alongside fellow legal non-profits, Palestine Legal and the National Lawyers Guild, the CCR took its case directly to Congress; it notified representatives that if they vote for an aid package to Israel they \u201ccould face criminal and civil liability for aiding and abetting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity\u201d.", "The organisation then followed up on November 13 with a lawsuit involving half a dozen American and Palestinian plaintiffs, accusing President Joe Biden and his secretaries of state and defence of enabling Israel\u2019s genocide. In the brief it submitted to the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the organisation argued that the Biden administration\u2019s unconditional support for Israel constitutes \u201ca breach of US responsibilities under customary international law, as codified in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\u201d.", "The organisations using US courts to charge Israel with genocide in US courts are not struggling to find evidence to support their claim.

These five acts are: killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group. Many genocide and international law experts across the world agree that Israel has committed in Gaza at least the first three acts in this list with undeniable intent, and is thus guilty of genocide.", "Just a week ago, on December 9, 55 scholars in Holocaust and genocide studies published an open letter condemning Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel, but also stating that \u201cthe starvation, mass killing, and forced displacement of Palestinian civilians in Gaza is ongoing, raising the question of genocide, especially in view of the intentions expressed by Israeli leaders\u201d.", "The legal case for the US\u2019s complicity in this genocide is equally strong.", "Katherine Gallagher, the lead lawyer for CCR\u2019s lawsuit against Biden and his colleagues, explained at a presentation in New York City that the US\u2019s actions in support of Israel \u2013 including sending expedited military and economic aid to the country, blocking United Nations Security Council resolutions to implement a ceasefire, and giving Israel advanced weapons that few other states get, among others \u2013\u00a0 clearly \u201ccross the lines of complicity in genocide\u201d.", "\u00a0\u201cThe US was put on notice of the likelihood of \u00a0genocidal actions, and it should have taken action to prevent it,\u201d she added, explaining that Israel could not pursue its present level of attacks without US aid and diplomatic protection at the UN.", "On December 8, the US government asked the North California District Court to throw out the lawsuit, arguing on jurisdictional grounds that the judiciary cannot intervene in the executive branch\u2019s foreign policymaking. The plaintiffs say the US is bound by the Genocide Convention it ratified and as such, must respect the requirement that all those who have the capacity to stop a genocide are obligated to do so.", "The government\u2019s demand that the CCR case is dismissed coincided with another US veto of a UNSC resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, and a move by the administration to circumvent necessary congressional approval to immediately send Israel more artillery ammunition,\u00a0 which only reiterated Washington\u2019s unconditional support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.", "A few days later, the World Health Organization said the healthcare situation in Gaza was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and warned that disease was spreading among the 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza forced from their homes by Israel\u2019s strikes and would probably worsen because of overcrowding in areas where civilians are seeking shelter. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, meanwhile, warned that there was \u201cno effective protection of civilians in Gaza\u201d and that there is increasing \u201cpressure for mass displacement into Egypt\u201d, signalling another war crime, known as forcible transfer, may be in the making. Around the same time, Save the Children said it had documented in Gaza the cases of more than 7,000 children under the age of five who were so malnourished that they required \u201curgent medical treatment to avoid death\u201d.", "As evidence for Israel\u2019s genocide mounts and the US media avoids acknowledging what is happening before our eyes, discussions on the nature and extent of Israel\u2019s crimes are throttled on US college campuses and in other public spaces; those daring to speak up are\u00a0branded\u00a0as\u00a0anti-Semites and terror supporters,\u00a0or even as advocates of genocide against Jews,\u00a0which makes it critical\u00a0that court cases\u00a0like\u00a0the CCR\u2019s\u00a0try and hold those responsible to account.", "Over the past week, the round-the-clock media coverage of accusations of anti-Semitism at elite American universities such as Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania repeated the charge that allowing pro-Palestine protests and statements on campuses promoted anti-Semitism and threatened Jewish students, faculty and staff. Some particularly ignorant and extremist members of Congress, the academy, and the media even suggested that the accelerating ceasefire and pro-Palestine protests could be seen as part of an attempted genocide against American Jews.", "Such an inversion of reality is not so unusual, when extremist pro-Israel fanaticism combines with equally hysterical desperation among American politicians. New benchmarks in political fantasy and dishonesty are now being set in the United States, when some extremists suggest that nonviolent activism for a Gaza ceasefire and equal rights among Palestinians and Israelis is genocidal, while the Israeli state, which claims to represent all the world\u2019s Jews, is committing a verified genocide in Gaza.", "History will not judge kindly the American media\u2019s failure to recognise and accurately report on this moment. However, in the absence of adequate media\u00a0\u00a0and political scrutiny, it is encouraging that scores of scholars bravely provide evidence and\u00a0\u00a0speak up on the issue, and that American courts \u00a0offer a venue to assess and hold accountable perpetrators and complicit state enablers of this generation\u2019s iteration of humanity\u2019s worst crime \u2013 genocide."], "subhead": "What is behind the American media\u2019s avoidance of the growing allegations of genocide directed at Israel?", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/12/15/watching-the-watchdogs-media-law-and-gaza-genocide"},

This made it much easier for Israel to continue stealing Palestinian territory with impunity. (In fact, since October 7, with the global community\u2019s attention firmly fixated on Gaza, Israel has sped up the expansion of its illegal settlement project in the West Bank, and began to openly arm fanatic settlers.)", "If Netanyahu has his way, what has happened to the West Bank will also happen to Gaza. Initially, the Strip will be split into three or more smaller entities with Israeli controlled \u201cbuffer zones\u201d in between.

They will not accept their fate quietly.", "An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is in the making.

As Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, has recently warned, if it is not stopped soon, Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, combined with its relentless siege, will unleash a humanitarian \u201ctsunami\u201d of catastrophic proportions, with not only bombs and bullets but also a variety of communicable diseases killing starving and fatigued civilians in their thousands.", "Rather than entrusting the fate of Palestinians to Israel \u2013 and its Western benefactors \u2013 as has been the case since Oslo, the international community, led by the global majority, should take matters into its own hands and engineer a just solution involving important regional and global players.", "The only way to provide a sustainable solution to this deep-rooted conflict is to acknowledge that it does not involve two actors on equal footing, but is rather between an occupying force (Israel) and an occupied population (the Palestinian people, both in Gaza and the West Bank).

The cost of reconstruction must be borne by Israel. It would be an injustice for those countries who have financed the reconstruction of Gaza following past wars to have to foot the bill once again.

This statement may sound cynical, cold, possibly even ill-informed, but it is true. Except for one party outside Gaza that can make it matter to people\u2019s pockets.", "On the security level, despite its intensity, cruelty and the number of civilian victims, the war in Gaza is at best a narrow regional affair with just two parties fighting seriously, mainly in the Gaza Strip. It could be argued that the occupied West Bank is increasingly becoming a battlefield but it is still a step below full escalation.", "Countries bordering Israel and the Palestinian territory: Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, are balancing their rhetoric to show they support the Palestinians and their cause, but intend to stay out of the conflict.", "That said, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah is sparring with Israel on a carefully weighed and limited scale, as are several much smaller groups in Syria, but all of them are demonstrating restraint and unwillingness to allow the fighting in Gaza to flash into a wider regional war. Jordan and Egypt are staying put and it would take a very major escalation to draw them into any kind of armed action.", "More distant powers that have interests and influence in the region, from Saudi Arabia and Turkey to Iran and the United States and a disunited Europe, are also threading cautiously, disinclined to spread the fighting either in intensity or in scope.", "On an economic level, the war in Gaza itself doesn\u2019t impact the world economy. Brutal bombing, indiscriminate targeting of unarmed citizens and civilian infrastructure, human suffering, misery, displacement, hunger and disease generate international compassion but, even if it gets worse, it is almost certain that fighting would remain contained to Gaza because business would continue as usual elsewhere.", "Unless\u2026", "This precarious informal balance of interests might be upset by the actions of a small but determined group: Yemen\u2019s Houthis who endanger shipping through the strategic Bab el-Mandeb between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean \u2013 a narrow passage that is the world\u2019s third-largest choke point for oil shipments after the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca. More than six million barrels pass through it every day, mainly on their way to Europe.", "For an average ship travelling at 16 knots (30km/h), passing through Bab el-Mandeb and Suez takes nine days less than going around Africa. It is also cheaper: Maritime experts estimate that the shorter route saves at least 15 percent on transport.", "But there are indirect costs: Attacks on maritime traffic increase insurance rates, danger compensations to the crews and other costs.", "Thus, while the war in Gaza does not cost citizens of neutral countries anything, the Houthis\u2019 stance in the Red Sea could make prices soar, first that of oil but then almost everything else would follow.", "Can the Houthi attacks be stopped? The first step is always diplomacy, but almost no power recognises the Houthis or talks to them, let alone has any sway. The only exception is Iran, which supports the Houthis in principle but it does not control them. Nobody knows their current relations but if Iran indeed does not want the conflict to escalate, then the Houthis might be acting against its better advice. So even Iran may not be able to do much.", "Sanctions would not work as various sanctions imposed on Yemen failed to stop the fighting there for the past decade or so.", "Attacks on international shipping that escalated with the kidnapping of the Galaxy Leader in November and then culminated in rocket and drone attacks against unarmed commercial cargo ships and heavily armed naval vessels of several countries are nothing new for the Houthis.", "They have a history of attacking ships in the Red Sea. During their conflict with an Arab, Saudi-led coalition, in January 2017, they attacked the frigate Al Madinah using three remote-controlled unmanned explosive boats, forcing the Royal Saudi Navy to withdraw from Yemeni waters.", "Encouraged by their success, in May and July 2018, they attacked two huge Saudi oil tankers with (Iranian-built) cruise missiles, similar to those used in recent attacks. Neutral-flagged ships were also attacked in the same period. To complicate matters further, in 2021, Iran and Israel engaged in an undeclared naval conflict in the Red Sea alongside Yemeni shores.", "Following the seizure of the Galaxy Leader, the US was reported to be considering designating the Ansar Allah, the official name of the Houthi movement, a \u201cterror group\u201d for involvement in \u201cpiracy of a ship in international waters\u201d. But the US trod carefully, reportedly consulting with other countries and deciding to not (yet) make the designation official. There were no reports of any talks with Tehran but they cannot be excluded as Washington certainly did not want to risk pushing the Houthis\u2019 big brother or its proxies like Hezbollah into a full war around Gaza.", "Yet, after the latest missile attacks against commercial ships, Washington is reportedly trying to put together a coalition of 12 nations to counter the Houthi threat to shipping. Warships from at least four nations\u2019 navies: US, France, United Kingdom and Israel are already active in the Red Sea and some have successfully thwarted attacks against themselves and against land targets in Israel.", "With a coalition, the number of warships\u00a0would increase and they could attack targets inside Yemen like launch sites, command facilities and missile storage sites.", "Besides ships in the Red Sea, the Houthis continued targeting Israel, undeterred by the lack of tangible results. Israel intercepted a number of long-range missiles, some by land-based antimissile defences, others over the Red Sea south of Eilat by Israeli fighter jets. On at least one occasion, Israel\u2019s most modern plane, the F-35 was used.", "Fully aware of the coalition brewing, the Houthis want to prevent it from becoming active and functional.

Many across the world were shocked to see children sing happily about \u201celiminating\u201d an entire people \u201cwithin one year\u201d. Yet a closer look at Israeli literature and curricula shows this open celebration of genocide was the only natural outcome of Israel\u2019s persistent indoctrination \u2013 or brainwashing to be more blunt \u2013 of its children to ensure that they do not view Palestinians as human and fully embrace apartheid and occupation.", "There is myriad evidence of Israel\u2019s brainwashing of its citizens to erase the humanity of Palestinians spanning many decades.", "Israeli scholar Adir Cohen, for example, analysed for his book titled \u201cAn Ugly Face in the Mirror \u2013 National Stereotypes in Hebrew Children\u2019s Literature\u201d some\u00a01700 Hebrew-language children\u2019s books published in Israel between 1967 and 1985, and found that a whopping 520 of them contained humiliating, negative descriptions of the Palestinians.", "He revealed that", "Such persistent negative descriptions dehumanised Palestinians in the eyes of generations of Israelis, established them as dangerous \u201cothers\u201d, and paved the way for children to celebrate their genocide in a video produced by the state broadcaster in 2023.", "Towering Palestinian academic and literary critic, Edward Said, also elaborated on the issue in his 1979 book The Question of Palestine, noting that Israeli children\u2019s literature \u201cis made up of valiant Jews who always end up by killing low, treacherous Arabs, with names like Mastoul (crazy), Bandura (tomato), or Bukra (tomorrow). As a writer for Haaretz said on September 20, 1974, \u201cchildren\u2019s books \u2018deal with our topic: the Arab who murders Jews out of pleasure, and the pure Jewish boy who defeats \u2018the coward swine!\u2019\u201d", "Israel has also used the painful memory of the Holocaust to desensitise Israeli children to the suffering of Palestinians and support without question Israel\u2019s treatment of them.", "In his 1999 book, One Nation Under Israel, historian Andrew Hurley explained how Israel weaponises the Holocaust education it provides to Israeli children against the Palestinians.", "\u201cThe mind of a child (or of anyone else for that matter) cannot absorb the horrors of the Holocaust without finding someone to hate,\u201d Hurley argued. \u201cSince there are no Nazis around against whom vengeance can be sought, [Former Israeli Prime Ministers] [Menachem] Begin, [Yitzhak] Shamir and [Ariel] Sharon have solved this problem by calling the Arabs the Nazis of today and a proper target for retribution.\u201d", "Israel\u2019s current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appears to be eagerly continuing with this tradition and has even claimed that it was a Palestinian who gave Adolf Hitler the idea for the Holocaust.", "Israeli professor Meytal Nasie strongly corroborates Hurley\u2019s view above on the ramifications of the way the Holocaust is taught. In her 2016 study, Young Children\u2019s Experiences and Learning in Intractable Conflicts, she found that 68 percent of Israeli children suggested \u201cbeating,\u201d \u201cfighting,\u201d \u201ckilling,\u201d or \u201cexpelling\u201d the Arabs as a solution. Nasie states that imparting these beliefs at such an early age, in a frequent and intense manner, leads to inculcation of these conflict-related narratives deep within the children\u2019s socio-psychological repertoires.", "Of course, the Israeli state\u2019s brainwashing of its citizens against the Palestinians is not limited to ridiculous lies about history told by political leaders or to children\u2019s literature. This propaganda effort is highly systemic and at the very core of Israeli education.", "Just take a look at Israel\u2019s official textbooks.", "For his 1998 research paper, The Rocky Road Toward Peace: Beliefs on Conflict in Israeli Textbooks, Israeli academic Daniel Bar-Tal analysed 124 Israeli textbooks on various subjects and for various age groups approved by the Israeli Ministry of Education to be used in religious and secular schools across the country.", "To map out the ideological content transmitted to Israeli children in the education system, he looked at which \u201csocietal beliefs (society members\u2019 shared cognitions on topics and issues of special concern for their society)\u201d received the most coverage in state-approved textbooks. He found that overall, the societal beliefs relating to (national) security received the most emphasis, followed by those concerning a positive self-image of Jews, and those that present Jews as the victims of the conflict. A majority of the analysed books were also found to include negative stereotypes about Arabs, portraying them as \u201ccruel, immoral, unfair\u201d and determined \u201cto annihilate the State of Israel\u201d.", "The widespread demonisation of the Palestinian \u201cOther\u201d in textbooks, coupled with the emphasis placed on the positive representations of Jews and the claim that they are the \u201cvictims\u201d in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and supported by overarching narratives about the importance of national security and survival, created the perfect conditions for generations of Israelis to leave the education system convinced that any and all aggression against Palestinians \u2013 including ethnic cleansing and genocide \u2013 are at least justifiable, if not necessary.", "This is because when children are thought that they belong to an inherently good \u201cchosen people\u201d and that they are being attacked and victimised by a demonic and inhuman \u201cOther\u201d, they easily accept the oppression, displacement or mass killing of those who belong to this \u201cOther\u201d (ie, the Palestinians) without any moral qualm or hesitation.", "Bar-Tal\u2019s study is from over 20 years ago, but more recent studies show that the situation is hardly any different today.", "For example, for her 2013 book, Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education, Israeli scholar Nurit Peled-Elhanan analysed Israeli history, geography and civic studies textbooks for grades 8-12 and reached a conclusion rather similar to Bar-Tal\u2019s: That in Israeli school books, Palestinians are still represented as evil \u201cOthers\u201d, and Israelis as innocent victims of history and circumstance.", "But there was another, important dimension to Peled-Elhanan\u2019s study. Since all Israelis are drafted into compulsory military service at 18 years of age, she designed her study around the specific question of \u201cHow are Palestine and the Palestinians against whom these young Israelis will potentially be required to use force, portrayed in school books?\u201d", "She found that the books commonly label Palestinians as \u201cterrorists\u201d and also \u201csimplify history\u201d to the benefit of Israelis.", "She concluded that Israeli textbooks prioritise \u201cthe creation of a usable past over accuracy and often harness the past and manipulate it for the justification of the present\u201d.", "\u201cThe books \u2013 in defiance of actual evidence- still present the Palestinians as the \u2018thugs\u2019 and the Israelis as the victims\u201d she wrote, and reflect the Zionist-Israeli opinion that \u201cthe Palestinians cannot be viewed but as an obstacle or a threat to be overcome or eliminated. Therefore their stories, their suffering, their truth or their human faces cannot be included in the narrative\u201d.", "In his book, One Nation Under Israel, Hurley explained the consequences of such indoctrination through the testimony of Israeli educator Shlomo Ariel, who had met with 10 groups, each made out of 50 Israelis about to enter the army, and discussed with them their perception of and attitudes towards Arabs.", "\u201cIn each discussion group there were a few who proposed physically liquidating the Arabs, right down to the elderly, women and children,\u201d Hurley quoted Ariel as saying. \u201cThey received the comparison between Sabra and Shatila (massacres in Lebanon) and the Nazi destruction favourably and said with full candour that they would carry out such destruction with their own hands with no inhibitions or pangs of conscience. Not one expressed shock or reservations about these declarations\u2026Many supported apartheid on the model of South Africa\u2026In each group, there were not more than two to three holders of humanitarian, antiracist views.\u201d", "Several decades have passed since Ariel had these discussions with young Israeli conscripts and learned that very few of them see Palestinians as human. Yet the ongoing brutal war on Gaza, and the many posts we see online by young Israelis \u2013 including many young conscripts \u2013 celebrating the carnage, applauding the military, and mocking Palestinian suffering, prove that little has changed since then.", "So no, no one should be shocked to see Israeli children singing happily about the genocide of the Palestinians.

It has arbitrarily removed Palestine-related content, disrupted live streaming, restricted comments, and suspended accounts.", "Among those who have been targeted is Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza, who had gained over 15 million followers on Instagram for documenting the Israeli atrocities in Gaza; his account was later reinstated. The Facebook page of Quds News Network, one of the largest Palestinian news networks with over 10 million followers, was also permanently banned.", "On Instagram, people posting about Palestine have experienced shadowbanning \u2013 a stealth form of censorship where an individual is rendered invisible on the platform without being notified.

Evidence, however, suggests otherwise.", "Two weeks into Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, Meta bent its rules to allow Ukrainians to express themselves freely.

Arabic language content is heavily over-moderated, while Hebrew content remains under-moderated. Up until September 2023, Meta didn\u2019t have classifiers to automatically detect and remove hate speech in Hebrew even though its platforms were used by Israelis to explicitly call for violence and to organise pogroms against Palestinians. A recent internal memo revealed they were unable to use the newly built Hebrew classifier on Instagram comments due to insufficient training data.", "This is deeply worrying in light of the fact that Meta significantly relies on automated content moderation tools.

These tools have repeatedly been revealed as poorly trained in Arabic and its various dialects.", "According to one internal memo leaked in the 2021 Facebook papers, Meta\u2019s automated tools to detect terrorist content incorrectly deleted nonviolent Arabic content 77 percent of the time.", "This partially explains the egregious impact we are seeing on people\u2019s ability to exercise their rights and document human rights abuses and war crimes. It also explains some unjustifiable system glitches, including labelling Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest mosque in Islam, as a terrorist organisation in 2021; translating the bios of Instagram users with a Palestinian flag to \u201cPraise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\u201d; and deleting footage of dead bodies from the al-Ahli Hospital bombing for violating its policy on adult nudity and sexual activity, no less.", "Meanwhile, Meta is allowing verified state accounts that belong to the Israeli government \u2013 including politicians, the Israeli army and its spokespeople \u2013 to disseminate war propaganda and disinformation that justifies war crimes and crimes against humanity including attacks on hospitals and ambulances, filmed confessions of Palestinian detainees, and almost daily \u201cevacuation\u201d orders for Palestinian civilians.", "Instead of protecting Palestinians in Gaza as they are facing what 36 UN human rights experts and other genocide scholars have warned amounts to genocide, Meta has approved paid ads that explicitly called for a \u201cholocaust for the Palestinians\u201d and wiping out \u201cGazan women and children and the elderly\u201d.", "Such disturbing calls for violence have made their way to other platforms as well. In fact, X seems to be leading other platforms on the amount of hate speech and incitement to violence targeting Palestinians.

Israel\u2019s plan to flood tunnels under Gaza with seawater may lead to the further contamination of underground water and soil, resulting in a water-related environmental and human disaster.", "The eco-normalisation of Israel has also extended into the energy sector.", "A few months ahead of COP27, in August 2022, two Israeli companies, Enlight Renewable Energy (ENLT) and NewMed Energy, signed a memorandum of understanding to develop renewable energy projects in Jordan, Morocco, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain, as well as Saudi Arabia and Oman, which have not officially normalised relations with Israel.", "Their plans include the development, construction and operation of wind and solar power plants and energy storage. These projects, of course, bolster the image of Israel as a hub for creative renewable energy technologies and help greenwash its image.", "Both Enlight and NewMed have been involved in projects that reinforce the Israeli occupation and apartheid. Enlight has two wind farm projects in the occupied and annexed Golan Heights and is developing another wind energy project in the northern part of the Naqab desert and the southern part of the occupied West Bank, in partnership with several illegal Israeli settlements.", "NewMed is a subsidiary of the Delek Group, which has been involved in gas exploration projects in disputed maritime areas, near Palestinian and Lebanese waters. It also owns a chain of petrol stations across illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and Golan Heights and supplies fuel to the Israeli occupation forces.", "Of course, the native Palestinian and Syrian populations of these occupied territories do not benefit from Israeli energy projects and they are effectively denied sovereignty over their energy resources.", "Palestinians inhabiting Area C have no access to the electricity grid in the area, which has been developed by Israel to serve Israeli illegal settlements. The Israeli authorities also refuse to issue them permits to set up solar panels, which could provide an alternative source of energy.", "In Gaza, before the war, Palestinians lived with just a few hours of electricity per day due to the Israeli siege. As part of the complete blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip since October 7, Israel has totally cut off electricity from reaching Gaza and targeted alternative sources of energy like solar panels. ", "Even the solar panel systems operating in hospitals such as al-Shifa have been bombed", ".", "Israel\u2019s exploitation of Palestinian resources to the detriment of the Palestinian people masked in the form of \u201cgreen projects\u201d is a perfect illustration of green energy colonialism.", "Energy colonialism refers to companies and states plundering and exploiting the resources and land of impoverished countries and communities to generate energy for their own use and benefit.", "As we have argued in our book Dismantling Green Colonialism: Energy and Climate Justice in the Arab Region, renewable energy colonialism is an extension of the colonial relations of plunder and dispossession.", "It effectively maintains the same political, economic and social structures that have generated inequality, impoverishment and dispossession in formerly and still colonised places and shifts the negative effects of energy production \u2013 including pollution \u2013 to these already marginalised communities.", "Eco-normalisation allows Israel to position itself in the energy and water sectors regionally and globally as a leader in innovation and green technologies, thereby reinforcing its political and diplomatic power.", "With the exacerbating climate and energy crises, it will likely use the increasing reliance of other countries on its technology and energy and water resources as yet another tool to marginalise and sideline the Palestinian struggle.", "Thus, there is an abiding connection between Israeli greenwashing, which is reinforced through eco-normalisation, and the consolidation of apartheid and settler colonialism in Palestine and the Golan Heights.", "The dark tunnel that is Palestinians\u2019 life under Israeli oppression is getting darker. Yet a glimpse of light can be seen that illuminates the Palestinians\u2019 long path to liberation: that light is the increasing resistance of the Palestinian people, who refuse to be isolated, dehumanised and obliterated.", "The struggle to topple Israel\u2019s oppressive occupation and apartheid regime is also part of the wider struggle for self-determination and emancipation of dispossessed and marginalised peoples across the world. Colonial attempts to further isolate Palestine from the rest of the Arab world through eco-normalisation can be thwarted by the collectively enacted power of Arabs and other peoples.", "To this end, social movements, environmental groups, trade unions, student associations and civil society organisations in the Arab region and beyond must intensify their protests against their governments until they end their normalisation ties with Israel. International grassroots movements should increase their support for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel and shine more light on the role Israeli \u201cgreen technology\u201d companies play in the colonisation of Palestine."], "subhead": "The image of a \u2018green technology pioneer\u2019 helps Israel to greenwash its occupation and apartheid in Palestine.", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/12/12/how-arab-eco-normalisation-of-israel-covers-up-its-crimes"},

{"title": "Israel should learn from French mistakes in Algeria", "body": ["On May 7, 1945, Nazi Germany signed the act of military surrender to the Allies. The next day, people all over the world, including in occupied Algeria, took to the streets to celebrate the end of World War II.", "An estimated 134,000 Algerians fought with the Allies and 18,000 of them gave their lives to defeat Germany. And so, on May 8,1945, in Setif, a city east of Algiers, some 5000 \u201cmoslems\u201d, as Algerians were called by the colonial power to erase their national identity, marched in celebration. But they also marched clamouring for the end of over a century-long French colonial rule over their country. French police seized banners and eventually opened fire, killing demonstrators. Clashes erupted with 102 French settlers killed.", "In the following fortnight, a blood frenzy overtook French authorities and settlers who massacred some 45,000 Algerians. Rural areas around Setif and the town of Guelma believed to be sympathetic to Algerian nationalists were bombarded by the French air force. Settlers avenged their compatriots by hunting down and lynching \u201cthe savages\u201d.", "To establish themselves in Algeria and legitimise their presence there, the colonists had dehumanised the indigenous population to the extent of perceiving them as nothing more than vermin.\u00a0 This allowed French colonists and their occupation army to kill Algerians in their thousands, with little or no moral qualms.", "The Setif massacre brought the colonial power another nine years of relative peace but in the end, it only served to harden the Algerian resolve to be free. On November 1, 1954, they embarked on their ultimate war of resistance against French occupation. After eight years of \u201ca savage war of peace\u201d as British historian Alistair Horne put it, Algeria won its independence but at a heavy price: The war claimed the lives of some 1.5 million Algerians; some 20 percent of Algeria\u2019s \u201cMoslems\u201d.", "What is happening in Palestine today, predominately in Gaza but also in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, is of course not identical to the events that marked the end of French rule in Algeria. Yet there are many similarities between them, as the modus operandi of most colonial enterprises follows a set pattern.", "Colonisers dehumanise indigenous populations to keep them pliant and to justify the use of brutal force against them when they try to resist their subjugation.", "They ensure that the colonised are powerless militarily, but often make the mistake of assuming this lack of military prowess also means that they lack the strength and resolve to resist oppression and defeat occupation. When they eventually realise their misjudgment and acknowledge that they cannot sustain their position indefinitely, they intensify their brutality to preserve the status quo for as long as possible. This is what happened in occupied Algeria in the latter years of French rule, and this is what we are witnessing in occupied Palestine today.", "When France responded to the killing of 102 settlers by carpet-bombing villages and killing tens of thousands of people, it was hoping to achieve much more than avenging the deaths of its citizens and eliminating \u201cterrorists\u201d. It was using extreme violence to eliminate all native resistance. It wanted to break their will to resist.", "Today, Israel is following a similar trajectory. It is now apparent that the goal of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza is not to avenge hundreds of Israeli civilians and military personnel killed on October 7. If vengeance were the primary motive, the killing of over 8,000 Palestinian children and babies and reducing most of the Strip into rubble would have likely been enough for Israel to call it a day.", "Killing all \u201cterrorists\u201d, completely annihilating Hamas to ensure the safety of the colony, does not seem to be the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war either. Israel\u2019s leaders undoubtedly know that even if their military could somehow eliminate all \u201cterrorists\u201d in Gaza, it would not be able to eliminate Palestinian aspirations for liberty and resolve to resist the occupation in every way possible. So if the aim is not to avenge the deaths of its citizens, or \u201celiminate terrorists\u201d, what is Israel trying to achieve?", "Israel is executing a multifaceted plan to protect, entrench and expand its colonial enterprise.", "It goes something like this:\u00a0First, break Palestinian will and spirit. Show them that Israel can do as it pleases, with total impunity, and in full view of an impotent world. That no matter how much violence and humiliation they experience, neither fellow Arabs nor the so-called international community would come to the rescue. That not even the sight of premature Palestinian babies suffocating in powerless incubators or the thought of thousands of children wasting away under the rubble could make the Western powers rethink their support of Israel.", "Second, once their will is sufficiently weakened, order Palestinians to leave their homes and their land. Order them to move, on foot, towards some vaguely defined \u201csafe zone\u201d. Once the displacement is complete, declare that Hamas is in their midst and bomb the \u201csafe zone\u201d anyway. Repeat the cycle until the entire Strip is destroyed, and all surviving Palestinians are pushed out into the Egyptian Sinai.", "Israel will make sure to complete this plan unless, of course, the Western governments, first and foremost the US, have a change of heart and intervene to make the carnage stop.", "When France was working through its own bloody plan to maintain its occupation in Algeria, then US President John F Kennedy made one such intervention. He clearly voiced his belief that French rule over Algeria was not sustainable in the long term, condemned colonialism, and openly rooted for Algeria\u2019s independence.

There has not (yet) been much fighting in the tunnels, and we have to wonder whether the foes will want to go into them at all.", "Wary of the length, spread and sophistication of Hamas\u2019s tunnels, the Israeli army was treading carefully. Urban areas were bombed heavily from the air from the start of the war on October 7, stopping only when Israeli ground forces were about to go in.", "Before the truce at the end of November, Israel managed to encircle Gaza City. Many Palestinians escaped to the south, heeding Israeli evacuation orders or simply fleeing for their lives.", "After the perimeter of Gaza City was taken, Israeli sources leaked that some field commanders felt the price in soldiers and equipment was lower than expected with 104 combat casualties so far. But the high command opted for a cautious approach, staying out of the densest, built-up areas: parts of the old centre and Jabalia refugee camp.", "Seemingly satisfied with what it did in Gaza City, the Israeli command decided to repeat the strategy in the south, where it has now almost fully encircled Khan Younis.", "It is impossible to determine whether the heavy civilian casualties and destruction of Palestinian infrastructure were collateral damage or part of the battle plan. This is likely to be debated for years, and there may never be one answer.", "On the ground, Hamas fought as expected: surprise attacks on Israeli forces using mainly shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons. Israeli casualty updates give insight into the fighting by comparing numbers of soldiers killed with the type, duration and reach of their advances.", "But it is difficult to track incapacitated armoured vehicles, and we cannot rely on Hamas\u2019s claims of destroyed Israeli tanks and armoured personnel carriers, which are exaggerated to boost morale.", "Hamas does not allow much information to leak, but by careful observation, a pattern appears: The leadership of the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, seems to be trying to keep the tunnels hidden and intact as long as possible.", "Rather than using them for daily tactical and operational purposes, it seems to prefer to keep them as shelters during bombardments, weapons storage and cover for its troops on the move.", "So Hamas fighters do not seem to be popping out of tunnel shafts and immediately targeting Israeli soldiers. They use tunnels to reach intended zones of operation but surface farther away and move through buildings and rubble for some distance to keep the locations of the shafts secret.", "Assessing why neither side initiated the tunnel war is a bit of a chicken and egg situation: impossible to say who did what first.", "The Israeli side was always wary of tunnel warfare, knowing it would be casualty-heavy. But after two incidents early in the fighting in which four special forces soldiers in one instance and two engineering troops in another were killed by booby traps as they tried to enter tunnels, \u00a0the initial reluctance may have turned into a staunch unwillingness to commit soldiers to underground combat.", "Caution in handling the tunnels means the Israeli army now just identifies and marks tunnel entrances, blocking or destroying them without entering \u2013 except in cases when it needs to go in the tunnels for public relations like at al-Shifa Hospital.", "But there are thousands of tunnel openings, and, aware of the difficulties of finding them all, the Israeli army is reportedly considering pumping them full of seawater, drowning those hiding underground or forcing them to come up and fight above ground.", "There may be a psychological reason for Israel to consider water as a weapon: Could it be a revenge of sorts on the Arab world?", "In 1973, the Egyptian army used fire hoses to breach Israeli sand berms on the Sinai shores of the Suez Canal. While high earthen walls were effective in protecting Israeli positions against shelling, canal water shot from fire hoses cut through the berms like a hot knife through butter, allowing Egyptians to push the Israeli army back.", "Fifty years later, the idea of using seawater as a weapon is being mulled although it is doubtful that it would be as decisive in Gaza in 2023 as it was in Sinai in 1973.", "Nobody except Hamas knows with certainty how the Hamas tunnels are structured, but multiple videos show that the network has watertight lock doors so it is probable that Hamas could protect parts of the network by closing sections off and bypassing any flooded ones.", "Over and above come the practical issues with this purported Israeli plan. Two million litres (roughly 530,000 gallons) of seawater would be needed to flood about a kilometre (0.6 miles) of tunnel, assuming the shafts are 2 metres (6.6ft) high and 1 metre (3.3ft) wide.", "Multiply that over the estimated 400km (250 miles) the network stretches, and the logistics become staggeringly complex.", "The pumps and pipes needed for this strategy would have to stretch from the seashore to where the tunnels begin, which is not a short distance, given that the tunnels are in the clay soil that starts away from the sandy shore. Having so much exposed equipment would open it up to attacks and sabotage.", "If Israel does choose to do this and somehow the technical part is successful, there remains the intractable problem of figuring out which section of tunnel it is pumping water into and what that means in the grand scheme of things.", "But in reality, the main reason for Israel to refrain from acting offensively inside the Hamas tunnel network is the remaining captives. According to an official Israeli count, 138 people taken from southern Israel on October 7 are still being held in the tunnels by Hamas.", "With nearly all hostages now Israelis, some with dual US citizenship, it is hard to envisage that any Israeli politician or military commander would be willing to risk his reputation at home by issuing orders to destroy parts of a tunnel network in which their own could be killed."], "subhead": "Both sides seem to be even more cautious about the tunnels than they were at the beginning of the conflict.", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/11/analysis-has-the-approach-to-tunnel-warfare-changed-for-israel-and-hamas"},

Two days later, its defence minister, Yoav Gallant, announced a full blockade of Gaza, cutting off supplies of electricity, fuel, water and food; \u201cWe are fighting human animals,\u201d ", "he said", ".", "Since then, more than 17,700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment of the Gaza strip, more than a third of them children. More than 1.7 million people have been displaced within the enclave, with civilians having no safe zone to flee to.", "Amid this death and destruction, the dominant narrative in Western media and political circles has been that this is \u201ca war\u201d, Israel has the \u201cright to defend itself \u201cagainst \u201cterrorism\u201d, and the Palestinian plight is a \u201chumanitarian\u201d issue. This framing of what is going on \u2013 backed with language borrowed from international law \u2013 completely distorts the reality on the ground.", "Everything that is happening now in Israel-Palestine is taking place within the context of colonisation, occupation and apartheid, which according to international law, are illegal. Israel is a colonising power and the Palestinians are the colonised indigenous population. Any reference to international law that does not recall these circumstances is a distortion of the story.", "The status of Israel as a colonising state was clear in the early days of the United Nations. It is notable that much of the peculiarity of the case of Palestine, and in turn, its susceptibility to misrepresentation and manipulation, is that it was colonised at the moment when mass-colonisation of the Global South was theoretically ending.", "For example, the representative of the Jewish Agency, Ayel Weizman, one of the main actors in enabling the Zionist project, ", "described", " what was happening at that time as Jewish \u201ccolonisation of Palestine\u201d during the hearings of the UN Special Committee on Palestine in 1947, as the recognition of the state of Israel was being deliberated.", "Resolutions issued by the UN General Assembly during the 1950s-1970s tended to couple Palestine with other colonised nations. For example, Resolution 3070 of 1973 declared that the UNGA \u201cCondemns all Governments which do not recognize the right to self-determination and independence of peoples, notably the peoples of Africa still under colonial domination and the Palestinian people\u201d.", "Similarly, the case of Palestine was also portrayed as a close relative to the case of apartheid South Africa. For example, Resolution 2787 of 1971 said that the General Assembly \u201cconfirms the legality of the people\u2019s struggle for self-determination and liberation from colonial and foreign domination and alien subjugation, notably in southern Africa and in particular that of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Guinea [Bissau], as well as of the Palestinian people by all available means consistent with the Charter of the United Nations\u201d.", "Following the 1967 war, Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza, the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights, prompted the UN Security Council Resolution 242, which in its preamble emphasised \u201cthe inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\u201d and called for the \u201cwithdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\u201d.", "However, the resolutions\u2019 deliberate ambiguity in referring to \u201cterritories occupied\u201d in the English version of the text, has been used by Israel to justify its occupation and annexation for over half a century. It also paved the way for Israel to start building settlements \u2013 something Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, defined in her report A/77/356 as \u201ccolonising\u201d the West Bank.", "The context of colonisation and occupation was brushed to the side with the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, which was presented to the international agreement as a \u201cpeace agreement\u201d that put an end to the \u201cPalestinian-Israeli conflict\u201d. It, of course, did no such thing.", "The oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian people at the hands of their Israeli colonisers continued.", "Removing the context of colonisation and occupation has facilitated the portrayal of Palestinians as exclusively being one of two categories: \u201cvictims\u201d of a humanitarian crisis or \u201cterrorists\u201d.", "On the one hand, framing the plight of the Palestinians as a humanitarian concern covers up its root causes. As multiple UN and rights organisations reports have pointed out, the Israeli occupation and apartheid have devastated the Palestinian economy and pushed Palestinians into poverty. The focus on the humanitarian element perpetuates aid dependency and sidelines demands for accountability and reparations", "On the other hand, the narrative that presents Palestinians as \u201cterrorists\u201d obfuscates the reality that the Israeli army\u2019s goal has always been the eradication of the \u201cPalestinian problem\u201d by any means possible, including ethnic cleansing, subjugation, and displacement. It also denies the Palestinian people the right to resist, which is outlined in international law.", "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights stresses in its preamble that \u201cit is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law\u201d. In effect, this means that rebellion against tyranny and oppression when human rights are not protected is acceptable.", "Similarly, many UN General Assembly resolutions from the 1950s-1970s, the First Protocol of the Geneva Conventions, and the case law of the International Court of Justice, provide evidence for the legitimacy of peoples\u2019 struggle by all means at their disposal in the exercise of self-determination.", "Of course, as they resist in whichever form, Palestinians are bound by the rules of the conduct of hostilities in international humanitarian law.", "The denial of the right to resist for the Palestinians goes hand-in-hand with Israel and its allies constantly evoking the Israeli \u201cright to defend itself\u201d. But Article 51 of the UN Charter, which legitimises the use of force in the name of self-defence, cannot be invoked when the threat emanates from within an occupied territory.", "The International Court of Justice re-affirmed this principle in its advisory opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (2004).", "It is important to point out that even though Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and settlements from Gaza in 2005, it still exercises effective control over the territory. This reality has been blatantly apparent over the last two months as Israel has resorted to cutting off food, water, medical supplies, electricity and fuel \u2013 all essential for the existence of the population of Gaza.", "According to international humanitarian law, Gaza is occupied by Israel and the latter cannot claim self-defence as a legitimate reason for its aggression against a threat that emanates from within a territory it has effective control over.", "In this sense, Israel is perpetrating war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of genocide in Gaza not in the context of \u201cself-defence\u201d, but of occupation. The Israeli army has undertaken the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of explosive weapons, forced displacement of over 1.7 million people in Gaza, the cutting off of fuel, electricity, food, water and medical supplies, amounting to collective punishment.", "Unfortunately, these crimes are not an anomaly, but a part of the continued systemic violence inflicted by Israel on the Palestinian people over the past 75 years.", "In trying to justify the shocking civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and its supporters have frequently evoked the laws of war, throwing around terms like \u201chuman shields\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d.", "Apart from the flawed arguments and lack of evidence that these claims suffer from, they also rely on a set of norms that were codified by colonial powers and are outrageously outdated.", "The laws of war were put together during colonial times to regulate the use of force between sovereign states. The colonies were obviously not considered sovereign equals, and the laws were designed to maintain domination over the indigenous peoples, territories and resources.", "These laws do not account for asymmetry in power between parties to a conflict. They do not respond to the technological changes in warfare. They are not designed to account for economic and political interests shaping war. Over the last 75 years, significant efforts have been made to challenge these shortcomings, but states of the Global North systematically undermined them.", "This is not surprising given that most contemporary wars happen outside the Global North, and profits coming from the business of war predominantly feed into Global North economies.", "It is not in the interest of powerful states to update these laws in a manner that corresponds to the reality on the ground. Instead of updating the laws of war to decolonise them, over the past 20 years, the Global North has imposed a new framework that accommodates its \u201cwar on terror\u201d.", "It is, therefore, not surprising that as Israel is exterminating Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, the mainstream international legal reaction has reflected a continuing colonial attitude which disregards distortions and misrepresentations and refuses to call things by their name \u2013 settler colonialism, resistance, and the people\u2019s right of self-determination.", "The only way out of the cycles of brutal violence is for the colonial context in Palestine to be fully and unequivocally acknowledged.

Sewage water has already flooded Gaza streets, but if rain mixes with the filth, the risks of cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases increase further.", "\u201cThe war damage to Gaza\u2019s water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure makes flooding more likely with the winter rains,\u201d Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, an independent research body based in the United Kingdom, said.", "Even before the current war, ", "inadequate sanitation infrastructure", " and electricity shortages meant that untreated sewage water was dumped into the sea and was ", "responsible", " for more than one-quarter of illnesses. It was the primary cause of child morbidity in the Gaza Strip.", "According to the\u00a0Norwegian Refugee Council, the total shutdown of wastewater treatment plants in October, after Israel imposed a complete blockade on any fuel entering the strip,\u00a0led to the release of more than 130,000 cubic metres of untreated sewage into the Mediterranean Sea daily, posing a grave environmental hazard.", "With the destruction amid the current war, huge volumes of debris and waste are blocking sewers, warned Weir. This, he said, \u201cwill allow more standing water, with associated risks to human health from transmissible diseases from wastewater mixing with rainwater.\u201d", "This war, like others before it, requires vast quantities of fossil fuel, leading to excessive carbon emissions and pollutants in the environment.", "Earlier reports", " suggest 25,000 tonnes of munitions were dropped on Gaza in the first few weeks of the war. The carbon emissions from this would equate with the annual energy use of approximately 2,300 homes, or the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from approximately 4,600 passenger vehicles.", "The world\u2019s military forces also use fossil fuels to operate aircraft, tanks and weapons, accounting for approximately 5.5 percent of global emissions. The figure could be higher as defence forces are not bound to report their carbon emissions as it may undermine national security.", "\u201cMethodologies to count emissions from conflicts are in their infancy,\u201d Weir told Al Jazeera.", "But things are slowly changing.", "Last week, the UN Environment Programme\u2019s flagship Emissions Gap report, which is released before each COP meeting, made mention of conflict and military emissions for the first time, calling for more research into the topic.", "Groups like Human Rights Watch have also accused Israel of using ", "white phosphorous munitions in Gaza", ", which added further to the pollution in the atmosphere, said Majdalani. \u201cAs Gaza enters the rainy season, we expect the rain to fall as acid rain, contaminated with white phosphorus.\u201d", "People who use plastic sheets to collect rainwater to drink directly, amid a shortage of drinking water, could be particularly at risk, she said.", "In the first weeks of the war, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA reported Israel dropped ", "42 bombs every hour", " on Gaza.", "In addition to the emissions from weapons, their manufacture also contributes to pollution, Weir explained. \u201cFar more emissions come from them during production, for example in creating the metal for their casings.\u201d", "Reports from Ukraine suggested the fighting there released some 100 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere in the first seven months of the war.", "So what about Gaza?", "\u201cWe anticipate that the bulk of the emissions in this war will be from military fuel use \u2013 Israeli jet fuel and diesel, from urban and landscape fires caused either by the destruction of buildings or targeted attacks, and from the carbon costs of reconstructing Gaza.\u201d", "Other risks include fires, pulverised building materials that can include harmful substances like asbestos, and pollutants released from facilities containing hazardous materials.", "Even rebuilding war-torn areas that have turned to rubble causes significant emissions. \u201cProducing concrete and cement to rebuild generates a large quantity of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the climate crisis,\u201d said Weir.", "Lennard de Klerk, from the Initiative in GHG Accounting of War, did a rough calculation on how much GHG emission would result from rebuilding just residential and non-residential buildings that were destroyed or damaged after the first six weeks of the war.", "He told Al Jazeera, \u201c5.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions would be released to produce construction materials and the emissions of the construction activities itself\u201d.", "That is already a fifth of the projected emissions for the reconstruction of Ukraine from its war, which has been going on for 21 months as opposed to two months in Gaza."], "subhead": "Gaza\u2019s water, soil and air have been devastated.

Israel already had those in its arsenal and used some, so this may be a simple replenishment or a modest build-up. While long and sometimes deep, Hamas tunnels are mostly not covered in thick layers of concrete, so Israel would need just a handful of bunker busters.", "Second, one could compare the number of conventional bombs delivered, 10,400 of two different weight classes, with the number of JDAM kits, 3,000.

Wars have terrible consequences, but just wars must be fought.

What is it that motivates you to protest so furiously now? I think the answer can be found in the fact that anti-Semitic attacks have reached shocking levels in the US. According to the Anti-Defamation League, from October 7 until October 23, anti-Semitic incidents rose by about 400 percent compared to the same period last year. It is hatred of Jews, hatred of Israel and support for Hamas \u2013 a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US, the UK and the EU, which has vowed to destroy Israel and to repeat the atrocities of October 7 again and again \u2013 that motivates you.

As the original deadline loomed an extension was proclaimed, but of just two days.", "Two is still better than nothing, and the two extra days bought the Qatari and Egyptian mediators extra time to work out how to convince both sides to prolong the truce even further or turn it into a permanent ceasefire.", "It has not been easy. While ", "negotiations through intermediaries", " have been difficult, long and often tedious, they did finally produce some results and an agreement in principle that led to the initial four-day truce and indirectly to the two-day extension. During initial negotiations, Israel unilaterally declared that the pause could be made longer by the release of additional captives, so not much had to be additionally negotiated. Yet, as more time passed, talks through Qatari and Egyptian intermediaries seemed to be dragging, and lists of detainees to be released kept being agreed upon and accepted later and later each day; at one point Hamas even threatened to stop the process and let the truce collapse.", "Now, on Wednesday evening, the situation appears to be more complicated than ever. Hamas announced that it is seeking a further four-day extension, and even hinted at being ready to negotiate the release of all captives it is holding, in exchange for a more lasting cessation of hostilities. At the same time, Israel said it welcomes the possible release of additional captives, but sent mixed messages about the continuation of the pause.", "In such an atmosphere of uncertainty mixed with anxiety and hope, international mediators are trying harder than ever.

Over the past few days, several representatives of the Israeli military indicated that they would prefer the current two-day extension of the pause to be the last. Generals told the political leadership that the military believes that fighting should be resumed on Thursday morning.", "From the very beginning of the armed intervention, the Israeli army was wary of having to go to war without clearly defined strategic goals. I warned that soldiers detest \u201copen-ended\u201d tasks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated several times that his goal was to win the war by destroying Hamas, but he obviously never translated that into clear and measurable orders and tasks. Generals prefer to be told: \u201cGo there and do that, if and when you achieve it your job is done\u201d.

In contrast, Al Jazeera and, to a certain extent, the BBC, clearly aspired to achieve greater balance, provide in-depth analysis, include historical context, and humanise all those affected by the conflict. Their efforts to provide quality journalism for their audiences only accentuated the shockingly poor performance of the US networks.", "No wonder the American public is so poorly informed on Middle Eastern issues, and the American government keeps failing at its \u201cpeace-making\u201d efforts and instead regularly sends military battalions and flotillas to the region.", "So, here is what struck me about the American television coverage of the Gaza ceasefire. Please keep in mind that this is not a scientific study, but a list of impressions and observations:", "An overwhelming majority of American journalists covering the events \u201con the ground\u201d were based in either Tel Aviv or Israeli West Jerusalem, and had no direct contact with Palestinians in Gaza.", "The dominant theme of the American coverage was the release of Israelis who were detained in Gaza (I\u2019ll refer to them and the thousands of Palestinians currently in Israeli jails both as \u201cdetainees\u201d\u00a0 to avoid, for now, the debate about who gets to be called \u201chostage\u201d or \u201cprisoner\u201d). American TV channels made little effort to convey to their audiences Palestinian points of view and sentiments. It is understandable for Israeli television to focus squarely on the Israeli detainees, but American television should at least try to present the complete story and create space for the sentiments and perspectives of both societies.", "The tremendous time and effort American hosts and correspondents committed to sharing with their audiences the powerful emotions of the families of Israeli detainees was impressive by any standard. There were repeated interviews, photo collages, video testimonies and countless emotive stories about the ordeals of the Israeli detainees and their worried families. Yet there was no similar intensity or extent of\u00a0 coverage of the sentiments of the Palestinian detainees and their families, who make up half of the story. Israeli detainees and their families were presented as real people, with names, ages and powerful human emotions, gripped by fear and hope, doing everything possible to save their family members detained in Gaza. We got to know them and feel their pain, which we were largely denied for the Palestinians.", "Anyone watching American news quickly learned the names of all the Israeli children detained in Gaza. Their stories, accompanied by photos and videos provided by their families, touched the hearts of all those who have been watching. I was particularly moved, for example, by the report on one little girl whose father brought her dog to greet her upon her return to Israel.", "All in all, the US coverage of the stories of Israeli detainees in Gaza and their families represented journalism \u2013 and humanity \u2013 at its emotional and narrative best. Yet in covering perhaps the second most significant political/military event in the century-long conflict between Zionism/Israel and Arabism/Palestine (after 1947/48), one would have expected American news networks to offer their audiences facts, personalities, emotions and social realities from both sides. One-sided coverage, however technically proficient and emotionally grabbing, is not news reporting, it\u2019s cheerleading.", "The words US anchors, hosts and correspondents used while covering these events also betrayed their biases. Israelis under the age of 16 or so were always called \u201cchildren\u201d, while jailed young Palestinians from the same age group were overwhelmingly referred to as \u201cminors\u201d. The female Israeli detainees were usually identified as \u201cmothers\u201d or \u201cdaughters\u201d or \u201cgrandmothers\u201d \u2013 and rightly so. The female Palestinian detainees, however, were mostly called just \u201cfemales\u201d or \u201cwomen\u201d \u2013 thus the audiences were not encouraged to see them as mothers, aunts, grandmothers and form emotional bonds with them.", "Hamas personnel were almost universally referred to as \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2013 perhaps an understandable nomenclature when describing those who participated in an attack against unarmed civilians, but not a useful or adequate one to describe all members of an organisation that performs political, military and social roles in society \u2013 and represents the latest manifestation of militant political resistance against Israel and Zionism\u2019s century of aggression against and subjugation of Palestinians.", "In some cases, networks followed minute-by-minute Israeli detainees\u2019 journeys from Gaza to their homes in Israel \u2013 flashing back to interviews with the families and forward to the preparations to greet them. In contrast, with very few exceptions, there was no serious attempt to provide similar coverage of the journeys of the Palestinian detainees or their families \u2013 even though access to many of these families in the West Bank was possible.", "Coverage of Palestinians welcoming their returning detainees was scattered and slightly formulaic, while coverage of the equivalent Israeli story was repetitive, tear-jerking and passionate.", "The analysts/commentators interviewed in the US by American networks provided extra layers of orientalist stereotyping of Palestinians and Arabs that offered little or no news value but pandered mainly to audiences\u2019 natural entertainment instincts, or the networks\u2019 jingoistic support of US policies in the region.", "So we heard former hostage negotiators in the US explain (assume, actually) what difficulties Israelis would face in freeing their detained nationals, including \u201cArab street\u201d pressures. We even heard that FBI agents were in Israel to investigate possible Palestinian crimes against American citizens\u00a0 \u2013 of course, no attempt was made by the networks to question whether similar efforts were under way to investigate the many Israeli crimes against the Palestinians, including the killing of more than 14,000 people, some of whom also happen to be American citizens.", "The most glaring shortcoming in the American television coverage of the recent events in Israel-Palestine was the almost total lack of any historical context that would have helped audiences make sense of the October 7 attack on Israel and everything that followed. This context was needed not to justify Hamas\u2019s attack, but merely to help people understand why it happened in this century-old conflict.", "Indeed, the attack on Israel cannot be fully understood and analysed without considering the half dozen other clashes between Israel and Hamas in the last 35 years since Hamas was born. Palestinians, and most of the international community, insist that the historical context of this conflict must be appreciated if the wars are to end and a route to coexistence is to be forged. Israel, on the other hand, is determined to shut down any historical analysis that could explain how a land that was 96 percent Palestinian a century ago is 80 percent Jewish Israeli now. When American television does not present any historical context, it explicitly sides with Israel on this central issue. It can do this as much as it wants in its opinion offerings, but not in news coverage.", "These quick observations are not a comprehensive analysis of the US television coverage of recent events in Israel-Palestine. I am aware that the US television networks have also provided a few moments of balanced coverage, during which Israelis and Palestinians were treated as equally human. Most of the coverage I saw, however, did not acknowledge the humanity of the Palestinians and instead reflected the dominant Israeli view that Palestinians are less than human and thus their suffering, emotions and aspirations could be ignored, minimised or presented superficially in media coverage.", "All media organisations, including the TV networks attempting to cover this century of conflict for American audiences, should aspire to practise better journalism and avoid as much as possible presenting entertainment and propaganda in their news broadcasts."], "subhead": "American television coverage of the Gaza ceasefire and the detainee exchange between Israel and Hamas has failed to provide American audiences with the full story.", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/11/28/watching-the-watchdogs-american-tv-gaza-and-two-sides-of-a-ceasefire"},

The ongoing truce has demonstrated that Israelis held captive can be easily freed without firing a shot. This could help sway Israeli public opinion \u2013 which so far has been overwhelmingly in favour of the war \u2013 towards a ceasefire.", "Some Israeli analysts are already\u00a0noting a shift favouring a truce extension. Indeed, continuing on the path of negotiations would limit the country\u2019s mounting economic losses and safeguard the lives of both its captives and soldiers.

The Biden administration\u2019s alternative \u2013 for the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority to assume control of the enclave \u2013 has been roundly rejected by both Israel and Hamas, which, in the absence of Israeli reoccupation, would remain the only power broker in Gaza.", "Instead of recognising this, the US has stubbornly refused to float any policy proposals that factor in Hamas\u2019s survival. In that wilful blindness, Washington is joined by a chorus of pundits who continue to\u00a0put forth\u00a0\u201csolutions\u201d that presuppose Hamas\u2019s destruction. But given the still-fresh memory of Afghanistan, US policymakers should know all too well that eradicating a homegrown resistance movement is, ultimately, impossible.", "More possible would be to build on the example of the current hostage deal, which showed that both Israel and Hamas have the political will to negotiate. By working with mediators Qatar and Egypt, the US can help move the conversation around Gaza beyond the disastrous \u201cwith us or against us\u201d rhetoric that characterised America\u2019s war on terror and into discussions about a long-term ceasefire, one that would need to be brokered through Hamas\u2019s political leadership-in-exile.", "There is precedent for this. Recall that, in December 2012, Israel allowed Hamas\u2019s then-leader Khaled Meshaal to\u00a0return\u00a0to Gaza as part of a negotiated truce after that year\u2019s eight-day war. Whether current exiled leader Ismail Haniyeh can moderate the position of his Gaza counterpart, Yahya Sinwar, who is widely believed to have masterminded the October 7 attacks, will depend on Haniyeh\u2019s ability to secure international relief and reconstruction funds.", "Just as important will be a US commitment to rein in Israel\u2019s extremist policies, including its siege of Gaza and backing for settler violence in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Once such a de-escalation happens, it will become critical for the international community to uphold its commitment to Gaza\u2019s reconstruction and development, easing the desperate conditions that helped give rise to the October 7 attacks.", "To be sure, no vision for a peaceful future can abide the murder of civilians. But finding a way out of the current crisis means reckoning with the reality laid bare by this war\u2019s first seven weeks: There is no way to wipe Hamas \u201coff the face of the earth\u201d that does not take untold numbers of Palestinian \u2013 and Israeli \u2013 lives with it.", "If Hamas\u2019s long-term survival strains the imagination, the risks of simply avoiding the thought are even more unimaginable. Although this is clearly not a widely held sentiment in Israel right now, some Israelis, like former government advisor and Bar-Ilan University professor Menachem Klein, are coming around to the idea. Speaking to Al Jazeera after the first Israeli hostages were released, Klein conceded that it is \u201cimpossible to totally destroy Hamas by force\u201d. The path forward, he argued, should include the group in renewed negotiations around a Palestinian state.", "Given the horrific suffering endured by the people of Gaza, growing international and domestic pressure to end it, and the still-looming prospect of a broader regional conflict, the US can no longer insist that eliminating Hamas is the only path to ending this war."], "subhead": "Seven weeks of war and a truce have demonstrated Israel is nowhere near its declared goal of eliminating Hamas.", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/11/26/it-is-time-the-us-considers-hamass-survival-in-gaza"},

Just days after hijacking the Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader, on Saturday their armed drones attacked the Malta-flagged CMA CGM Symi without attempting to board it, unlike the next incident on Sunday when they first attacked from the air and then tried to hijack the Central Park, flying the Liberian flag. US Navy destroyer USS Mason, patrolling the Gulf of Aden, intervened, forcing the attackers to flee the ship.", "The Houthis, known for tenacity and aggressiveness, obviously do not feel obliged to refrain from attacking what they see as Israeli assets, so it is a blessing that their arsenal appears unable to mar the current agreement.", "After three days of quiet and captives from both sides coming home, we should remind ourselves that this almost idyllical respite is only scheduled to last until Tuesday and that in less than 24 hours, explosions will again rock the Gaza Strip and more people, civilians and soldiers, will be killed.", "As the expiry of the truce neared, both sides toyed with the possibility of extension. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, venturing into Gaza territory for a brief propaganda photo op amid heavy security, hinted that the truce could be extended if Hamas continued releasing hostages and that every group of 10 would buy another day of pause. Hamas told the Reuters news agency that it is seeking to extend the truce but wanted more Palestinians freed from Israeli jails.", "While something might be cooking under a tightfitting lid and civilians in Palestine and Israel seem hypnotised by three days of \u201cpeace\u201d, soldiers and politicians remind them that it is only a pause after which the fighting is scheduled to continue. Chief of General Staff General Herzi Halevi said on Sunday that once the pause expires, his forces \u201cwill return to our operations with determination, for the continued release of the hostages and the complete dismantlement of Hamas\u201d.

I have never seen a ceasefire last until the agreed-upon moment: Usually, they are either extended by an agreement made while they still last or they are broken before the deadline.", "In the absence of an official extension, it is very likely that fighting might resume on Monday night after the last batches of hostages are out and the last aid trucks are in. Realising that the last prisoner exchange is over, soldiers might not see a need to wait for hours until the official expiration.

Not a shot was heard as the fighters took a much-needed respite.", "All hopes now are that the pause will hold as intended and the ambitious plans for the 96 hours of uneasy truce will be carried out.", "A column of Israeli armoured vehicles headed towards Israel, taking soldiers home for short chance to recover. They were not being fired at, so crews stood in open hatches or allowed themselves the luxury of sitting on the vehicles\u2019 steel bodies, basking in the morning sun, obviously trusting the pause and not showing signs of anxiety or fear. Many smiled, demonstrating clear relief, as the plan looked like it was working.", "Palestinian fighters also headed outdoors. Many changed into civilian clothes and rushed south to see family members and check who survived the intense bombardment and indiscriminate shelling.", "Reporters saw aid agencies not waste a second, the first trucks carrying much-needed supplies crossing the Rafah checkpoint from Egypt minutes after Zero Hour. One hundred crossed into the Gaza Strip on day one, and more are scheduled.", "The first real test, the late afternoon exchange of 13 Israeli captives held by Hamas for 39 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, 24 women and 15 teenage boys, also passed smoothly.", "Proving how sensitive the affair is, and fully aware of the possibility that a minor glitch could delay or even stop the planned exchanges, the two sides opted not to handle the logistics directly. Instead, they chose the safest approach, using intermediaries and, in the case of Israeli captives, going through an indirect route.", "Hamas first handed 13 Israeli captives to the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (ICRC), who took them across the border into Egypt in a convoy of vehicles, handing them over to Egyptian authorities.", "Egyptian \u201cpossession\u201d was very brief, as all Israelis were quickly transferred to their country\u2019s secret service, Shin Bet, who flew them by helicopter first to a military base in the Naqab Desert (also called Negev), and then to civilian hospitals where they were reunited with their families.", "But this captive release procedure with all its intricacies was not Friday\u2019s first. About half an hour before the liberation of Israeli captives, another group unexpectedly served as proof-of-concept: 10 citizens of Thailand and one Filipino were released, under the same procedures that would be used for the most anticipated group.", "The Thai captive deal was apparently negotiated separately, with Egypt as an intermediary. The suddenness with which it surfaced out of complete secrecy proves the nature of the complex negotiations for the release of the captives.", "Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners in a much simpler procedure \u2013 no go-betweens or roundabouts: the women and teenagers had first been transferred to Israel\u2019s Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank. At the agreed time, the gates opened, and they were released to their waiting families and then on to East Jerusalem where thousands of Palestinians joined in an impromptu emotional celebration of their return to freedom.", "At the same time, most Israelis were anxiously watching live coverage of the return of the first batch of their compatriots.", "An Israeli colleague told me on Saturday that it was only when his family realised how stressed and worried they had been during the seven weeks of collective concern for the captives that they thought of the Palestinians\u2019 anxiety for their own, held for many years. \u201cAfter this, we may see them with different eyes\u201d, he said.", "There was no doubt that both sides were overwhelmed by emotions and some observers hoped that the realisation of how much pain both societies are in might somehow bring them together after the war ends.", "But the good news of civilians being set free was marred by less-publicised news of others being killed in spite of the fighting being on pause.", "While the two militaries refrained from shooting at each other as agreed, the Israelis demonstrated that, in their mind, the truce extends only to the two armed sides.", "Israeli forces confronted hundreds of Palestinian civilians trying to return to their homes in north Gaza during the pause. They were defying Israeli orders to remain in the south, distributed in the media and air-dropped leaflets, and Israeli soldiers fired at them.", "Two people killed and 11 wounded by direct, aimed, assault-rifle fire is a sad reminder that, as welcome as it is now, the agreed pause has its definite limits, in duration and in scope and a warning against getting euphoric and too hopeful too soon."], "subhead": "Everyone stopped shooting, but can emotional reunions bring new understanding between warring sides?", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/analysis-lessons-from-day-one-of-truce-in-gaza"},

Perhaps most importantly, the US and Israel, which repeatedly vowed to eradicate Hamas, are now negotiating with the Palestinian movement and reaching agreements with it. Qatari-Egyptian mediation, while indispensable, is ultimately a formality. The US and Israel are not negotiating with Egypt and Qatar but with Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and architect of the October 7 attacks.", "The tenor of Israeli press reports in recent days has been that Hamas is desperate for a respite, however brief and at almost any price, from the ferocious Israeli onslaught against the Gaza Strip.", "Yet the available reports about the deal suggest otherwise: Israel has committed to releasing three times as many imprisoned women and children as the Palestinians; no Israeli soldiers are included in the exchange; significantly more humanitarian supplies, including fuel, will reach the Gaza Strip; the exchange of captives will be implemented during a continuous four-day truce rather than one in which the slaughter is paused for a brief period each day; and Israeli jets and drones will be prohibited from using the airspace over the Gaza Strip for several hours each day.", "This is quite close to the deal initially offered by Hamas several weeks ago, and it appears the bulk of its demands have been conceded by Israel and the US. If the adage that negotiations reflect reality on the ground rather than overturning it applies, Hamas \u2013 in contrast to the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip, which has been Israel\u2019s main target \u2013 seems far from desperate. Instead, it appears sufficiently confident to stick to its priorities until these are accepted by the US and Israel.", "Pursuant to the agreement, Hamas has also forced the US and Israel to consent to the supply of large amounts of essential humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip. In other words, Hamas has in one fell swoop achieved exponentially more on the humanitarian front than the much-vaunted US diplomacy to secure humanitarian relief for Gaza\u2019s Palestinian civilians during the past month.", "This confirms that the entire US effort was in essence a circus \u2013 a diversionary charade to enable Israel to continue with its mass killings and transform the Gaza Strip into a wasteland and a killing field.", "It bears repeating that Hamas has forced the US and Israel to allow significant quantities of food, water, medicine and fuel to reach the civilian population of the Gaza Strip. Yet Hamas is the anointed terrorist organisation in this equation while Israel is the light unto nations with the world\u2019s most moral army and the US \u2013 the world\u2019s greatest democracy dedicated to spreading freedom and human rights to the rest of the planet.", "What happens next is difficult to assess. According to reports, only Israeli and dual nationals are to be released, presumably to help the Israeli leadership swallow this very bitter pill and to allay Israeli concerns that the release of foreign nationals would be privileged in negotiations with Hamas. Yet by insisting on this formula, Israel has ensured that further negotiations to release foreign citizens would continue, potentially leading to an extension of the truce.", "At the same time, it is difficult to believe that the Israeli leadership can accept a temporary truce that metamorphoses into an indefinite one. It is clearly in the Israeli premier\u2019s personal and political interest to keep this conflict going while the security establishment is also desperate to wipe away the stain of October 7. Other members of Israel\u2019s governing coalition partners see this war as a golden opportunity to unleash the apocalypse and want it to escalate further rather than wind down.", "Although the Gaza Strip has been substantially destroyed, Hamas has yet to be significantly degraded, and the Israeli army has yet to kill more Hamas commanders than United Nations staff.", "If Israel is confident it can once again flout US policy without consequences, it will. This could take the form of sabotaging the truce or resuming hostilities to ensure it is not extended. Farther afield, the Israeli-Lebanese front also seems to be rapidly heating up.", "So further escalation is likely, but it is also possible that the implementation of this deal could cause Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government to collapse under a combination of public pressure and internal conflicts among leaders who mutually detest and distrust each other.", "The US leadership is also a question mark. With respect to the impact of this crisis on US interests in the region and beyond and particularly the question of regional escalation, US President Joe Biden appears not to care, Secretary of State Antony Blinken appears not to know while CIA Director William Burns and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin look mortified.

The residents of Gaza have borne the brunt of it, with more than 14,000 people killed by indiscriminate Israeli bombardment, including more than 5,500 children.", "The onslaught has extended to the West Bank as well, where the Israeli army and settlers are carrying out raids and killing civilians daily; more than 200 have been murdered, thousands detained and scores tortured. Palestinian citizens of Israel, too, have been subjected to arrests, harassment, and economic retribution, through dismissals from jobs.", "But the ongoing violence is not meant to quench the thirst for \u201cvengeance\u201d, as some have suggested. It is systematically moving towards a long-term goal: the complete erasure of Palestinian existence within historic Palestine. This plan was in the workings already even before October 7; it has now simply been accelerated.", "On Gaza, Israeli officials have been more than clear. There will be a full expulsion of the population. As Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter ", "stated", " on November 11: \u201cWe are practically repeating the Nakba if you will, this is the Nakba of Gaza.\u201d", "A leaked internal document from the Ministry of Intelligence has confirmed that the Israeli government is aiming to make good on these threats.", "Israeli plans for a Nakba in the West Bank are also coming to the fore. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said there need to be \u201cbelts\u201d around the illegal Israeli settlements that \u201cArabs\u201d will be banned from entering.", "Earlier this year, he also outlined plans to ensure territorial continuity for the Israeli settlements, which would effectively amount to more expulsions of Palestinians from their land and its annexation.", "For the Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, who make up 21 percent of the Israeli population, the plan may not be that publicised, but it is there. They too face a Nakba and it too has been long in the making.", "After the establishment of the Israeli settler-colonial state in 1948, which resulted in the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians from their towns and villages, the Israeli government scrambled to prevent the return of refugees, which the United Nations had guaranteed in Resolution 194 of 1948.", "That is why it decided to establish military rule in the Palestinian territories it occupied, where almost 150,000 Palestinians had managed to remain. This special regime aimed at not only preventing any Palestinians from trying to go back to their homes, but also at surveilling and persecuting the remaining population, with the ultimate goal of eventually expelling them.", "Archival documents, described in Israeli historian Adam Raz\u2019s book The Kafr Qasim Massacre: A Political Biography, showed that a plan was prepared in the early 1950s to deport the Palestinians to Jordan, Lebanon, and Sinai in the event of war.", "In 1956, when Israel, along with Britain and France, invaded Egypt trying to gain control of the Suez Canal, it saw an opportunity to turn on the remaining Palestinian population. Israeli border guards attacked the village of Kafr Qasim on the border between Israel and the West Bank, then administered by Jordan, killing 49 people, including 23 children. The attack was aimed at instilling fear in the Palestinian population and compelling them to flee \u2013 a tactic already employed in 1948.", "But it backfired. News of the massacre spread, which resulted in international pressure on the Israeli authorities to backtrack on pursuing their forced transfer strategy. Furthermore, their own intelligence assessment showed that many of the remaining Palestinians did not pose a major \u201csecurity\u201d threat.", "Over the following decade, military rule over the remaining Palestinians persisted; they were denied the right to movement, civil liberties, and basic services. They were only granted these rights after 1966. They were also given Israeli citizenship, but that did not make them equal to the Jewish citizens of the state.", "Those who were displaced were still denied the right to return to their homes; their lands remained confiscated. Palestinian communities were never granted the same level of services as Jewish settlements and towns were; they never received the same care from the state in terms of education, healthcare, etc.", "Their economic prosperity was curbed, dooming many of them to hardship and poverty. All this was accompanied by an assimilation strategy aimed at erasing the Palestinian identity and sense of nationhood and rendering the Palestinians a silent, faceless minority with a second-class citizenship.", "After the 1950s, the population transfer strategy was put on the back burner, but it was never completely renounced. In the 2000s, it came back, albeit in an updated form.", "In September 2000, the second Intifada broke out as the so-called \u201cpeace process\u201d failed to deliver on Palestinian statehood and Israel continued to expand its illegal settlements in the Palestinian territories it occupied in 1967. The trigger was a provocative raid by former Israeli Defence Minister Ariel Sharon on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam\u2019s third-holiest site.", "As Palestinian demonstrations erupted in occupied East Jerusalem and spread to the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians in Israel took to the streets, fully embracing the national Palestinian cause. They organised protest actions, which were brutally suppressed by the Israeli security forces.", "These events shook the Israeli establishment and intelligence and forced them to reconsider their strategy of assimilation toward the Palestinians within Israel. This is how the transfer strategy was put back on the table and remodelled to fit the new reality.", "Instead of resorting to massacres to scare Palestinians into leaving, the Israeli authorities decided to disrupt and destroy Palestinian communities from within and thus trigger an exodus.", "Economic opportunities for Palestinians sharply dwindled after 2000, leading to a high unemployment rate. The neglect from which Palestinian communities already suffered then worsened even more, while the Israeli authorities allowed and facilitated organised crime to proliferate.", "In parallel, the Israeli authorities pushed for further entrenching apartheid within Israel through legal measures. Perhaps the most significant among them was the ", "Jewish Nation-State Law", " that was passed in 2018.", "The law declares that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, effectively confirming it as an ethnocracy and denying the collective rights of Palestinian citizens and their Palestinian identity.", "On the basis of it, the Israeli authorities undertook the full suppression of non-Jewish national aspirations, including any talk of land restitution or return to displaced villages or any expression of identity through cultural, political or economic activities. Even the Palestinian flag was banned.", "The \u201cUnity Uprising\u201d in 2021 \u2013 when Palestinians in Israel joined their brothers and sisters in occupied East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank, and Gaza, in protesting and resisting the eviction of Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah and encroachment on Al-Aqsa \u2013 made the Israeli authorities even more anxious.", "Israeli officials began being even more vocal in their threats against the Palestinians in Israel. They spoke of a \u201ccivil war\u201d and a \u201cnew Nakba\u201d, while the Supreme Court ruled in favour of stripping Palestinians of their citizenship for \u201cbreach of loyalty\u201d.", "After Hamas\u2019s October 7 operation, threats and intimidation against the Palestinians in Israel escalated. Ultimatums such as \u201cyou must choose to be either Israelis or terrorists with Hamas\u201d, have been frequently repeated in Israeli media. Some commentators have even suggested that \u201csympathetic\u201d Palestinians should be expelled to Gaza.", "The suspicion of treason and disloyalty against the Palestinian community has become pervasive. There have been hundreds of arrests and detentions for questioning over the past month and a half. Palestinian rights organisation Adalah has recorded at least 70 indictments against Palestinians with Israeli citizenship.", "In one particularly publicised case \u2013 that of actress Maisa Abd Elhadi \u2013 the charge has been \u201cincitement to terrorism\u201d for a post on Instagram and the Ministry of Interior has already requested the revocation of citizenship.", "Meanwhile, some Palestinian politicians, like Mansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List, have embraced this new reality of suspicion and demands for demonstrations of loyalty from the Palestinian community.", "Abbas, who had previously rejected the \u201capartheid\u201d label for Israel, has criticised protests against the war on Gaza and called for the resignation of his fellow Knesset Member Iman Khatib-Yassin over her scepticism about the Israeli version of the events of October 7.", "All of these events point to what the Nakba for Palestinians in Israel will look like. The Israeli authorities will continue their policies of letting the Palestinian community become unliveable, suppressing any political activity or expression of Palestinian identity.", "Those who resist or express dissent will be summarily accused of \u201cterrorism\u201d and stripped of their nationality.

We are a university with a mission of \u201cAny Person, Any Study\u201d.", "But here at Cornell, we do not feel equally protected by the University, and we do not feel equally able to express ourselves. Most recently, we were horrified by the threats made to our Jewish community. We applaud the president for issuing a swift and forceful statement of condemnation.

Moreover, we ask that you offer administrative protections against doxxing and implement community care alternatives instead of intensified policing, which has been a touchstone of your response. Free speech for all and a hate-free atmosphere are complementary values to the standing against anti-Semitism initiatives announced by President Pollack on November 1, 2023.", "These recent threats are a part of a larger climate of alienation, racism, harassment, intimidation, and doxxing on our campus, and part of wider attempts to divide oppressed peoples. We call on the president to condemn this climate of hate and to work proactively to restore the value of free speech and create conditions for furthering understanding.\u00a0The administration\u2019s lack of an avowal of all of our experiences and rights to expression has left BIPOC and otherwise vulnerable members of our campus community feeling unseen and unsafe.", "We have been appalled by anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic posters and a truck vilifying an African-American faculty member, and we feel bereft that this incident has gone unacknowledged by the administration. The president and Board of Trustees chairman\u2019s statements to the campus on October 16 condemned the faculty member and gave cover to the subsequent doxxing.", "As the Cornell Chapter of the American Association of University Professors put it in their\u00a0", "recent statement", ", the university\u2019s announcement of an investigation into our colleague\u2019s conduct was a mistake, and it \u201cshould have instead declared forthrightly that free speech for all people, on any issue, within \u2018the limits of the law and the University\u2019s anti-harassment policy,\u2019 is a core value that the University will defend\u201d.", "The administration\u00a0bears responsibility for the risk, scrutiny, and overall danger, especially for faculty, staff, and students who are BIPOC, international, and otherwise marginalised. Collectively, related to our duties as faculty, staff, and students working on questions of domination and oppression, we have faced: international harassment campaigns, circulation of our personal addresses, unsolicited hate mail, threats to our families, calls for our firing, office vandalisation, the donning of intimidating logos in our classes, photographing and videotaping of our activities on campus, screenshotting and circulating of our classroom communications, charges of reverse racism, threats of poor course evaluations, and an unwillingness to sponsor events on Palestine.", "This hostile work environment has had a chilling effect on our research, teaching, and studying. The climate thwarts our educational mission which guarantees \u201cany person, any study\u201d. Many of us are now afraid to speak freely and have resorted to wearing masks to hide our identities on campus.", "Without adequate support, some of us have been forced to retreat from the community altogether. Doxxing, intimidation, and harassment are known to inflict mental health, economic, and social damage, often to family members and other innocent victims. Moreover, research shows that those from historically excluded and marginalised communities are more likely to be subject to racist intimidation and threats.", "We want to be clear that doxxing and harassment is a collective problem. When one person is targeted, it has a ripple effect. As such, these practices require collective and structural, not individualised, attention and responses. The issue is not limited to those of us who study and teach Israel/Palestine, but also applies to teachers and students of the United States, Russia and Ukraine, China, Nagorno-Karabakh, and elsewhere, as well as colonialism, racism, casteism, militarism, empire, gender/sexuality, democracy/authoritarianism, and other topics related to domination and oppression.", "The actions from the university that we would like to see do\u00a0not\u00a0include increased policing, security and surveillance, which have been touchstones of the university\u2019s response.
