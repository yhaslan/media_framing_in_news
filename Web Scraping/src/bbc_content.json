After all, that is what has happened after every other Middle East war since 1948, when Israel won its independence. ", "But there are other options.

From that moment of victory, some Israelis were set on extending the Zionist enterprise into the newly occupied Palestinian territories: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. ", "Since 1967 they have been highly successful, despite being forced to leave Gaza when Israel pulled out in 2005. Around 700,000 Israeli Jews now live in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Settler leaders are in the cabinet, and their enterprise is at the centre of Israeli politics.

Settlers have paved illegal roads and sought to entrench themselves even deeper by consolidating outposts that are illegal under Israeli as well as international law. Posters are everywhere demanding the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza. ", "Settlers have also killed Palestinians and invaded their homes. Men with bulldozers came at night to destroy the tiny village of Khirbet Zanuta, near Hebron. Its population of 200 Palestinians had already left, forced out by armed and aggressive settlers.

", "In his office in Ramallah on the West Bank, Mustafa Barghouthi told me that Israel is using the war to deliver a crushing blow not just to Hamas but to the idea of Palestinian independence and freedom. Like many Palestinians, Barghouthi sees what's happening as a grim echo of the events of 1948 when Israel won its independence and more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced at gunpoint to leave their homes in what became Israel. Palestinians call it al-Naqba, \"the catastrophe\" and believe Israel wants it to happen again.

And there will be resistance to their occupation, which they cannot tolerate. And that's why Netanyahu's goal really is to ethnically cleanse people. He wants to have military control of Gaza without people. He knows very well that Gaza with people is something that is unmanageable.\" ", "Barghouthi believes Gaza should be part of a democratic Palestinian state.", "\"We Palestinians are grown up people. We don't need any patronage of anybody. And no, we don't need any other country to tell us how we should rule ourselves.\"", "This crisis looks as if it will have more chapters. The US veto of the latest ceasefire resolution at the UN Security Council gives Israel more time to wage war. But that extra time is not indefinite, and continued Biden support for Israel carries a political price in America's coming election year. Influential members of his own Democratic party oppose what he's doing, and so do younger voters whose support he needs. The Biden Administration is already deeply uncomfortable that Israel is ignoring its repeated requests to protect civilians and respect the laws of war.

He set a high bar for victory; not just annihilating Hamas as a military force, but also destroying its capacity to govern. Israel's vast military power, reinforced by American resupply, has not yet destroyed the capacity of Hamas to fight.

", "Sinwar, 61, widely known as Abu Ibrahim, was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. His parents were from Ashkelon but became refugees after what Palestinians call \"al-Naqba\" (the Catastrophe) - the mass displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral homes in Palestine in the war that followed Israel's founding in 1948. ", "He was educated at Khan Younis Secondary School for Boys and then graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic language from the Islamic University of Gaza. ", "At that time, Khan Younis was a \"bastion\" of support for the Muslim Brotherhood, says Ehud Yaari, a fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who interviewed Sinwar in prison four times. ", "The Islamist group \"was a massive movement for young people going to the mosques in the poverty of the refugee camp\", Yaari says, and it would later take on a similar importance for Hamas.", "Sinwar was first arrested by Israel in 1982, aged 19, for \"Islamic activities\" and then arrested again in 1985. It was around this time that he won the confidence of Hamas's founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.", "The two became \"very, very close\", says Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. This relationship with the organisation's spiritual leader would later give Sinwar a \"halo effect\" within the movement, Michael adds.", "Two years after Hamas was founded in 1987, he set up the group's feared internal security organisation, the al-Majd. He was still only 25.", "Al-Majd became infamous for punishing those accused of so-called morality offences - Michael says he targeted shops that stocked \"sex videos\" - as well as hunting down and killing anyone suspected of collaborating with Israel. ", "Yaari says he was responsible for numerous \"brutal killings\" of people suspected of co-operation with Israel. \"Some of them with his own hands and he was proud of that, talking about it to me and to others.\"", "According to Israeli officials, he later confessed to punishing a suspected informer by getting the man's brother to bury him alive, finishing the job using a spoon instead of a spade. ", "\"He is the kind of man who can gather around him followers, fans - together with many who are simply afraid of him and don't want to pick any fights with him,\" Yaari says.", "In 1988, Sinwar allegedly planned the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. He was arrested the same year, convicted by Israel for the murder of 12 Palestinians and given four life sentences.", "Sinwar has spent a large part of his adult life - over 22 years - in Israeli prisons, from 1988 to 2011. His time there, some of it in solitary confinement, appears to have radicalised him even further. ", "\"He managed to impose his authority ruthlessly, using force,\" says Yaari. He positioned himself as a leader among the prisoners, negotiating on their behalf with prison authorities and enforcing discipline among the inmates. ", "An Israeli government assessment of Sinwar during his time in prison described his character as \"cruel, authoritative, influential and with unusual abilities of endurance, cunning and manipulative, content with little... Keeps secrets even inside prison amongst other prisoners\u2026 Has the ability to carry crowds\".", "Yaari's assessment of Sinwar, built up over the times they met, was that he is a psychopath. \"[But] to say about Sinwar, 'Sinwar is a psychopath, full stop,' would be a mistake\" he says, \"because then you will miss this strange, complex figure\".", "He is, Yaari says, \"extremely cunning, shrewd - a guy who knows to switch on and off a type of personal charm\".", "When Sinwar would tell him Israel must be destroyed and insist there was no place for Jewish people in Palestine, \"he would joke, 'Maybe we'll make an exception of you'\".", "While incarcerated Sinwar had become fluent in Hebrew, reading Israeli newspapers. Yaari says Sinwar always preferred to speak Hebrew with him, even though Yaari was fluent in Arabic. ", "\"He sought to improve his Hebrew,\" Yaari says. \"I think he wanted to benefit from somebody who spoke higher Hebrew than the prison wardens.\"", "Sinwar was released in 2011 as part of a deal that saw 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released from jail in exchange for a single Israeli hostage, the IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. ", "Shalit had been held captive for five years after being kidnapped by - amongst others - Sinwar's brother, who is a senior Hamas military commander. Sinwar has since called for more kidnappings of Israeli soldiers.", "By now, Israel had ended its occupation of the Gaza Strip and Hamas was in charge, having won an election and then eliminated its rivals, Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, by throwing many of its members off the tops of tall buildings. ", "When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he was immediately accepted as a leader, Michael says. Much of this was to do with his prestige as a founding member of Hamas who had sacrificed so many years of his life in Israeli prisons.", "But also, \"people just feared him - this is a person that murdered people with his hands\", Michael says. \"He was very brutal, aggressive and charismatic at the very same time.\"", "\"He's not an orator,\" says Yaari. \"When he speaks to the public, it's like somebody from the Mob.\"", "Yaari adds that immediately after leaving prison, Sinwar also forged an alliance with the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades and chief of staff Marwan Issa.", "In 2013, he was elected a member of Hamas's Political Bureau in the Gaza Strip, before becoming its head in 2017.

Media reports have since surfaced asserting he may still be alive, active in Hamas's military wing hiding in tunnels beneath Gaza and may even have played a part in the 7 October attacks.", "Sinwar's reputation for ruthlessness and violence earned him the nickname of The Butcher of Khan Younis. ", "\"He's a guy who imposes brutal discipline,\" says Yaari, \"People knew in Hamas and they still do - if you disobey Sinwar, you put your life on the line.\"", "He is reputed to have been responsible for the 2015 detention, torture and murder of a Hamas commander named Mahmoud Ishtiwi who was accused of embezzlement and homosexuality.", "In 2018, in a briefing to the international media, he signalled his support for thousands of Palestinians to break through the border fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel as part of protests over the US moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. ", "Later that year he claimed to have survived an assassination attempt by Palestinians loyal to the rival Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank.", "Yet he has also shown periods of pragmatism, supporting temporary ceasefires with Israel, prisoner exchanges, and a reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. He was even criticised by some opponents as too moderate, Michael says.", "Many in Israel's defence and security establishment believe it was a fatal mistake to have let Sinwar out of prison as part of the prisoner exchange.", "Israelis feel they were lulled into a false sense of security in the mistaken belief that by offering Hamas economic incentives and more work permits, the movement would have lost its appetite for war. This, of course, turned out to be a disastrous miscalculation.", "\"He sees himself as the guy destined to liberate Palestine - he's not about improving the economic situation, social services for Gaza,\" says Yaari. \"It's not him.\"", "In 2015, the US State Department officially categorised Sinwar as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\". In May 2021 Israeli airstrikes targeted his home and office in the Gaza Strip. In April 2022, in a televised address, he encouraged people to attack Israel by any available means.", "Analysts have identified him as a key figure linking Hamas's political bureau with its armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which led the October 7th attacks in southern Israel.", "On 14 October, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt Col Richard Hecht, called Sinwar \"the face of evil\". He added: \"That man and his whole team are in our sights. We will get to that man.\"", "Sinwar is also close to Iran. A partnership between a Shia country and a Sunni Arab organisation is not an obvious one, but both share a goal to end the state of Israel and \"liberate\" Jerusalem from Israeli occupation.", "They have come to work hand in hand. Iran funds, trains and arms Hamas, helping it to build up its military capabilities and amass an arsenal of thousands of rockets, which it uses to target Israeli towns. ", "Sinwar expressed his gratitude for the support in a speech in 2021. \"Had it not been for Iran, the resistance in Palestine would not have possessed its current capabilities.\"", "Yet killing Sinwar would be more of a \"PR victory\" for Israel than it would actually impact the movement, Lovatt says. ", "Non-state organisations tend to operate like a hydra's head - one operational commander or figurehead leader gets removed and they are quickly replaced by another. Their successor sometimes lacks the same experience or credibility but the organisation still manages to regenerate itself in some form.", "\"Clearly, he would be a loss,\" says Lovatt, \"but he would be replaced and there are structures in place to do that. It's not like killing Bin Laden. There are other senior political and military leaders within Hamas.\"", "Perhaps the bigger question remains this - what happens to Gaza when Israel ends its military campaign to eradicate Hamas, and who will ultimately be in charge?

", "body": ["Before Qafisha had even adjusted his eyes to the light and spotted us coming down the road towards him, the Israeli soldier had sprung to his feet, raised his rifle halfway and ordered Qafisha back inside.

", "\"We are not even allowed to stand at our windows.\"", "Qafisha, who was born and raised in Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, is a resident of H2, a dense and heavily fortified district that is home to 39,000 Palestinians and roughly 900 Israeli settlers considered some of the most extreme in the occupied territory. The Palestinians and Israelis of H2 are separated in some places here by just a few feet, and surrounded by cameras, cages, checkpoints, concrete blast walls and rolls of razor wire. ", "For more than 40 days now, since the Hamas attack on Israel, 11 Palestinian neighbourhoods within H2 - comprising about 750 families - have been under one of the harshest lockdowns imposed on the area for more than 20 years. H2's population is almost entirely Palestinian, but the district is under the total control of the Israeli military, which has for the past few weeks been forcing Palestinian residents back inside their homes at gunpoint.", "Qafisha and his family of nine had barely left the house, he said. He did not want to take any risks. \"You saw what happened when you arrived,\" he said. \"We have a door we cannot open and windows we cannot look out from. We do not have any freedom. We are living in fear.\"", "Qafisha's house sat just off Shuhada Street, once one of the busiest Palestinian market streets in Hebron. In 1994, a massacre of 29 Muslims by a Jewish extremist at a nearby mosque led to riots, which in turn prompted a crackdown by the Israeli army. The army forcibly closed Palestinian businesses and then welded shut the front doors of the Palestinian residents, on the Shuhada Street side.", "Since then, the Palestinians of the area around Shuhada Street have lived through shifting restrictions on where they can go, when, and how. Flare-ups in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have often led to some form of lockdown, but several residents told the BBC that this was the harshest they had ever experienced.", "A few hundred feet up the road from Qafisha's house, Zleekhah Mohtaseb, a 61-year-old former tour guide and translator, was staring down from her rooftop, watching a young Israeli settler shouting to himself as he meandered slowly down Shuhada Street. ", "Mohtaseb had had spent all her six decades within a stone's throw of where she stood now, she said. Directly across Shuhada street, no more than 20 feet away, was Hebron Cemetery, where 10 generations of her family were buried. Once upon a time, she could walk straight across the street and into the cemetery. Now it took her an hour by car.", "\"The settlers,\" she said, shaking her head, as the young Israeli walked past her welded-shut front door. \"They can do what they want. They are the chosen people.\"", "Mohtaseb had seen a lot in her lifetime in Hebron, but the past 40 days had been among the most tense, she said. Hours after Hamas attacked Israel, in a murderous rampage that left an estimated 1,200 Israelis dead, Palestinian residents of H2 received messages from the Israeli military telling them that they were no longer allowed to leave their homes. Israeli soldiers began forcing people off the streets at gunpoint, including Mohtaseb. \"Those first two weeks were hell,\" she said. ", "Two weeks after it began, the curfew in H2 relented slightly, allowing the Palestinians to leave their homes for certain hours on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Then this past Thursday, as Mohtaseb was preparing to meet us, three Palestinian militants from Hebron attacked an Israeli checkpoint dividing the West Bank from Jerusalem, killing one soldier and wounding five. Immediately, she knew that the attack would prolong and intensify the crackdown in H2.", "\"Everyone says that Israel has the right to defend herself. Fine. We are not against it. But what about us, the Palestinians?\" she said.", "\"Many times we were attacked, many times we were killed, many times we were forced from our homes. Where was this right to defend when the Palestinians were attacked?\"", "H2 began life in 1997 when Hebron was divided into two sectors, under an agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel. H1, populated entirely by Palestinians and controlled by the Palestinian Authority, accounts for roughly 80% of the city. H2, which accounts for just 20% of the city, is populated almost entirely by Palestinians but controlled by the Israeli military. Within H2, the area around Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque is the most fortified by checkpoints and guard posts. It has seen decades of tension, violence, and terror attacks from both sides. ", "\"This is the closed place inside the closed place,\" said Muhammad Mohtaseb, a 30-year-old hospital security guard, sitting on the roof of his house opposite the mosque. ", "\"We are completely surrounded by checkpoints,\" he said. \"Even on a good day, I cannot drive a car, no car can come in with Palestinian number plates. If I want to bring something to my house, I have to carry it half a kilometre from the checkpoint. When I got married, I bought all new furniture for my bedroom, but I had to take it all apart into pieces on the other side of the checkpoint to get it through the turnstiles, then rebuild it on this side.\"", "That was a good day. Since 7 October, the freedom even to move around in the street was gone. When we arrived at Mohtaseb's home, just like at the home of Fawaz Qafisha, a soldier sprang towards the door and ordered Mohtaseb back inside. ", "Up on the roof, Mohtaseb rolled a cigarette and looked out over the empty streets. With three of his four children out of school - the H2 schools have all been closed - Mohtaseb had been at home and away from work for 40 days. Fortunately for him, his employer had been understanding and was still paying him.", "This was not the case for everyone. Qafisha, the falafel cook, had been unable to fulfil his work responsibilities since the lockdown began, because he could only go out three days a week, and on those three days the allotted hours did not match the hours he would need to travel for work anyway. And unlike Mohtaseb's employer, his had not been understanding. \"In these jobs, if you work you eat,\" he said. \"And if you don't work you don't eat.\"", "Qafisha had borrowed money several times from friends, to buy food for the family, but he was running out of options. \"Anything that you spend you cannot replace,\" he said, sitting in his living room, away from the window. \"So we are sinking.\" ", "The following morning, there was another armed attack on Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian militant, this one in Hebron itself. This time it resulted in only the attacker's death. But a few hours later, another message was sent out via WhatsApp from the Israeli military to the Palestinian residents of Shuhada Street.", "\"A notification for the residents of Shuhada Street,\" it said. \"You are forbidden to be in the streets for one week.\" And if they left H2, it said, they would not be allowed to re-enter until the week had passed.", "The lockdown in H2 was a \"blatant example of how Israel is implementing collective punishment in the West Bank\", said Dror Sadot, a spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem.", "\"The Palestinians in Hebron are paying a price for something they didn't do,\" she said. \"People cannot go to work, children cannot go to school, they are having trouble getting water and food. It is collective punishment, and it is illegal under international law.\"", "The Israeli military told the BBC in a statement that its forces operate in the West Bank \"in accordance with the situational assessment in order to provide security to all residents of the area.\"", "\"Accordingly, there are dynamic checkpoints and efforts to monitor movement in different areas in Hebron,\" it said.", "Among the Israeli settlers living in H2, in the hardline Kiryat Arba settlement, is Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. On Thursday, Ben Gvir, who has personally overseen the distribution of thousands of new rifles to West Bank settlers since October 7th, said that Israel should take the same approach to the occupied territory that it was taking in Gaza, where more than 11,000 Palestinians have now been killed. \"Containment will blow up in our faces,\" Ben Gvir said, of the West Bank. \"Just like it did in Gaza.\"", "According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October, by settlers or in clashes with the military.", "On Wednesday, just a few hundred metres from Ben Gvir's house, Areej Jabari had gathered a small group of women into a knitting circle in her home in H2, in defiance of the Israeli orders not to move in the streets that day. This was only the second successful gathering since the lockdown began, and there were only eight women present, down from around 50 who usually gather once a week at the mosque. The knitters had got there by sleight. \"We sneak through the side roads and between the buildings,\" said Huda Jabari, Areej's younger cousin, with a grin. ", "The women have learned, this long into the lockdown, to observe the Israeli soldiers and move when they are not looking. They use one another's houses to avoid checkpoints within H2, entering the front door in one sector and emerging from the back door into another. \"In normal times, 50 families pass through my house to get around,\" said Areej's mother Sameera, whose own house sat in the shadow of Ben Gvir's.", "Areej took us up to her roof to show us her view, over an Israeli military base and guard post close to her house. Below us, Israeli settlers passed by along her street, which she was no longer allowed to use. ", "Since 7 October, Areej had been coming up here to the roof with her video camera to gather footage of the soldiers and send it to B'Tselem, the human rights organisation. In return, the Israeli military arrived at her house last Saturday and forced their way in, she said. \"They broke my press card and warned me not to take any more video or post anything on social media.\"", "They also forbade her to go up onto her roof, she said, or look out of her windows on Fridays or Saturdays, when the Israeli settlers use her road to walk from the settlement to the Jewish holy site near Shuhada Street. ", "The IDF told the BBC that it was aware of the incident Areej described and was following up with the specific soldiers involved to examine what happened. \"We are taking this incident very seriously,\" a spokesperson said.", "To Areej, it did not feel particularly out of the ordinary. \"Any time something happens they put more restrictions on us,\" she said. \"The goal is to divide us, to split the area into small pieces and to pressure us to leave.\"", "She was standing up against the railing around the roof of her home, looking out over H2. \"I call this area the fortress of steadfastness,\" she said.

", "In the luxurious surroundings of Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, amid giant floral bouquets and glittering chandeliers, and a world away from the shattered landscape of Gaza, princes, presidents and prime ministers met for the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit.", "Blame for the war and the destruction of lives and property was heaped unilaterally on Israel and its supporters. No-one criticised Hamas for its 7 October raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 240 taken hostage, triggering the massive military retaliation. Israel, said the secretary general of the Arab League, had committed criminal acts.", "\"We warn of the disastrous repercussions of the retaliatory aggression by Israel against the Gaza Strip, which amounts to a war crime,\" said the final communique. \"We warn of the real danger of the expansion of the war as a result of Israel's refusal to stop its aggression and of the inability of the [UN] Security Council to enforce international law to end this aggression.\" ", "Few people I spoke to at the summit expected Israel to take much notice. Instead, it was clear that this summit and its intended message of unity was aimed at Israel's biggest backer - the United States. Leaders want the Biden administration and the West in general to exert sufficient pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether.", "But what they could not agree on was how to achieve that. The summit pulled together some strange bedfellows - an indication of just how worried the region is at events in Gaza spiralling beyond their control. ", "Iran - Israel's main adversary - attended, with President Ebrahim Raisi striding across the carpeted halls in his black, cleric's robes, flanked by his scowling security men in dark suits and collarless shirts.

", "The Saudis, together with their conservative Arab allies like Egypt and Jordan, see these movements as dangerous destabilisers.", "As he departed Tehran airport for Riyadh, President Raisi said that now was the time for action over Gaza, not words. ", "But anyone expecting concrete, punitive actions against the US or the UK was left disappointed. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which only recently opened full diplomatic, trade and security ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, resisted calls to break them off.", "Syria's President Bashar al-Assad was also at the summit. Until very recently he was a pariah in the Arab world for the repressive actions of his regime in Syria's civil war. He told the summit it would achieve little without concrete measures, but suggestions of an oil embargo or the expulsion of US bases from Arab countries were quietly batted away.", "Yet there is no denying that the 7 October Hamas raid and the ensuing war has changed the whole paradigm in the Middle East.", "Up until that murderous morning in southern Israel the tectonic plates of regional politics were shifting away from the interests of Iran and its militant allies. Six Arab nations had already established full ties with Israel; Saudi Arabia was well on the way to being next. The Israeli tourism minister visited Riyadh just days before the Hamas raid. Dubai has been luring Israeli tourists in large numbers and there has been a huge Arab appetite for Israel's expertise in technology, surveillance, bio-tech and other sectors.", "With the exception of Qatar, which hosts the exiled political leaders of Hamas, Gulf Arab rulers had grown tired of what they saw as the corruption, inefficiency and infighting of Palestinian leadership. While sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Palestinians, still without a state after 75 years, they largely took the view that Israel was too important a nation to ignore, and that it was time to move on and normalise ties with it. The question of a future Palestinian state, while still featuring in speeches, was getting little practical attention.", "Today, those Arab-Israeli ties, while not yet broken, are certainly fraying at the edges. ", "\"We are really worried about the radicalisation of our youth,\" one Arab foreign minister told me on background. \"They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry.\" ", "Time and again I heard delegates complain that the actions of the Netanyahu government have gone far beyond self-defence and are now dragging the region down a dangerous path. There are concerns that extremist narratives are gaining popularity online.", "Arab and Muslim leaders are frustrated that the UN Security Council has failed in their eyes to exercise any restraint on Israel's military in Gaza. America's opposition to a ceasefire has deeply embarrassed those countries it calls allies in the region. ", "Washington's strategic alliance with the oil-rich Gulf Arab states dates back to 1945 and a wartime meeting on a US warship in the Red Sea between President Roosevelt and the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. Today, the US still provides the bulk of Saudi and Gulf Arab defence and security needs.", "But below the surface things are changing. Ever since the Obama administration's \"pivot to Asia\" there has been a fear here in the Gulf that the US is losing interest in the region, that it cannot be relied upon as a loyal partner. At the same time, the influences of Moscow and Beijing are in the ascendant. China recently brokered the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. President Putin has impressed Arab leaders with his unstinting support for Syria's President Assad. They compare this with how quickly Washington abandoned Egypt's President Mubarak in 2011 when the crowds came out on Cairo's Tahrir Square.", "None of this means the West has lost the friends it had in the Middle East. Those Arab allies are clearly reluctant to go beyond angry words with Washington. But they do want to be heard and for the violence in Gaza to stop now, before events in the region and in their own countries risk deteriorating far beyond their control."], "date": "2023-11-14T16:12:43.000Z", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67417570"},

Some point to the fact that it took nine months for Western-backed Iraqi forces to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State (IS)group in 2017. Israel may want to carry on fighting for several more months, though it may not control the timetable, as international pressure for pauses in the fighting or even a ceasefire are growing.

It claims they are now \"deep in the heart of the city\", though that is still far from claiming control. Hamas has denied that Israeli forces have made any significant gains or pushed deep into Gaza City.", "This initial phase of Israel's ground offensive appears to be going according to plan with its aim of isolating Hamas, and the cost to Hamas is likely to have been high. Estimates at the start of the war suggested that the group had between 30,000-40,000 fighters. ", "One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that about 10% of that total - 4,000 fighters - have been killed. Such estimates are impossible to verify and should be treated with caution, but the sheer scale of Israel's bombing campaign will have already degraded Hamas's ability to fight.", "In contrast, Israeli military losses appear to have been relatively low.

Yossi Kuperwasser, an Israeli intelligence and security expert, says the military is conducting its ground operations \"more carefully and cautiously\" to avoid heavy casualties among its troops.", "It's still not clear how much of Hamas remains in the north, how many fighters may still be hiding in tunnels, or how many might have melted into the local population who have fled south.", "The tunnels still present a significant challenge to Israel. Its forces are trying to blow up what tunnels it finds, rather than engage in fighting underground.

It has complete air superiority with Israeli jets and drones able to monitor every movement on the ground, but not below the surface.", "One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that they were still identifying more than 100 new targets each day, although that list is likely to diminish the longer this war goes on. The longer it lasts, the more it will have to rely on troops on the ground to identify and eliminate resistance.", "Justin Crump, a former British Army officer who now runs Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, says Israel appears to be making reasonable progress given the density of the terrain, but \"they're now going to encounter the more heavily defended urban areas of the city\".", "Israeli troops are better equipped and well-trained, but urban warfare can still prove difficult for the most advanced militaries. ", "So far, close-quarters fighting on the ground appears to have been limited, and is certainly nothing on the scale of the urban warfare that's been taking place between Russia and Ukraine in cities like Bakhmut. Much of the videos released by the IDF show that it is instead relying on tanks and armour.", "Neither has Israel committed all its forces. Some estimate that it may have as few as 30,000 troops inside Gaza so far. That's a relatively small proportion of Israel's total - 160,000 active military personnel plus 360,000 reservists. ", "Justin Crump says the question is how many of its infantry is it willing to commit to clearing every building and the warren of Hamas tunnels? ", "Israel could instead chose to target Hamas strongholds. He believes Israel will try to avoid block-by-block fighting, not least because it could lead to very heavy casualties. It would also certainly jeopardise the lives of more than 200 hostages. ", "Which raises the question as to whether Israel's stated war aim - destroying Hamas - is really achievable. Even senior Israeli officials recognise that destroying an ideology with bombs and bullets is impossible. ", "Some of the group's leadership isn't even in Gaza.

So far, more than 200 have been arrested - each serious in its own terms, including some allegations of support for Hamas - which is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. ", "But put those numbers in the wider context of public order policing in London.", "On Monday alone, police arrested 219 Just Stop Oil demonstrators who tried to stop traffic near Parliament. The Extinction Rebellion \"sit-ins\" of more than two years ago saw officers cart away a staggering 4,118 demonstrators. ", "Opponents of the PSC say marchers are chanting deeply antisemitic slogans and providing a cover for extremists. But while individuals can be arrested for hate crime offences, the legal test for banning an event is more complex. ", "The Public Order Act 1986 gives Sir Mark Rowley and other police chiefs the power to apply conditions to marches where they reasonably believe there could be: ", "The PSC has agreed to conditions under that law. Its supporters say they will gather an hour after the two-minute silence on Armistice Day and more than a mile away from the Cenotaph. Their march, ending with a rally at the US Embassy, is planned to go nowhere near the memorial. ", "Rishi Sunak has described holding a march on Armistice Day as disrespectful and a risk to the Cenotaph or other memorials. ", "But given the PSC has repeatedly abided by conditions imposed on its previous marches, the only conclusion the police can reach - unless they get intelligence to the contrary - is that a risk to the Cenotaph won't come from protesters on the march route. ", "And that's why the force has concluded there is no legal justification to ask the home secretary to ban the march. ", "That power can only be used if a police chief believes they cannot prevent \"serious public disorder\". That basically means violent crowds potentially bent on running amok. The police haven't seen that in previous weeks.", "So if police commanders asked the home secretary to ban the march, the organisers could go to court - and judges would need to see evidence and intelligence proving the serious risk.", "The last time these powers were used was in 2011 and 2012. The then-home secretary, on the recommendation of the Met, banned the far-right English Defence League (EDL) from marching through Muslim communities. The EDL was considered to be a thuggish mob and marchers would regularly chant racist or Islamophobic slogans.", "The Campaign Against Antisemitism says the \"River to the Sea\" chant, that will almost certainly be heard on Saturday's march, is deeply offensive and threatening - but the PSC event is not going through Jewish communities - and the Met says that its legal advice is that the slogan can be legitimate free speech in such circumstances.  ", "What would happen if the march were banned? The Met believes people would still come to London and stand in the street and peacefully have their say. The police cannot stop them. The last time they tried, it was a fiasco. ", "In March 2021, the organisers of a vigil for murdered Londoner Sarah Everard cancelled the event. They feared they would individually face enormous fines under the then Covid lockdown rules, if they were seen to encourage the gathering. ", "But there was such confusion over whether there was still a right to protest, regardless of the risk of transmitting the virus, that people turned out anyway. They felt so strongly about the horrific murder they wanted to be heard. The Met ended up paying compensation to women who were arrested.   ", "So the huge risk is that, even if Suella Braverman got her way, people would not only come out, but they would march independently. That would be twice as hard for police because there would be no organisers on the ground directing events and calling on people to abide by a route and curfew.", "And then there is the risk of counter-demonstrations.", "Former Met commander Dal Babu says Ms Braverman's attack on the forthcoming march has emboldened the extreme far right.

", "One certainty is that Israelis support the military campaign to break the power in Gaza of Hamas and its junior partner, Islamic Jihad. Their anger is driven by the shock of the Hamas attacks, the killing of more than 1,400 people and the fact that around 240 hostages are still being held in Gaza. ", "I met Noam Tibon, a retired general in the Israeli army, to hear about how he drove down with his wife to Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza, after Hamas attacked on 7 October. His mission, which was successful, was to rescue his son, his daughter in law and their two young daughters who were in their safe room, hearing Hamas gunmen roaming around outside. ", "Tibon may be retired but he is a very fit-looking 62-year-old. He ended up armed with an assault rifle and a helmet he had taken from a dead Israeli soldier, leading a group of soldiers he had assembled in the chaos of that day, clearing the kibbutz and saving the lives of his family and many others. ", "The general was an old-school, straight-talking Israeli officer. ", "\"Gaza is going to suffer\u2026 no nation will agree that your neighbour will slaughter babies, women or people. Just like you (Britons) crushed your enemy during World War Two. This is what we need to do in Gaza. No mercy.\" ", "What, I asked, about innocent Palestinian civilians who are getting killed? ", "\"Unfortunately, it's happening. We live in a tough neighbourhood, and we need to survive\u2026 we have to be tough. We have no choice.\"  ", "A lot of Israelis are echoing his sentiment that Palestinian civilian deaths are unfortunate, but they are being killed because of the actions of Hamas. ", "It is also clear that Israel's assault on Hamas is causing terrible bloodshed. The latest figure for Palestinian deaths from Gaza's health ministry, run by Hamas, has exceeded 9,000 - of whom around 65% are children and women. ", "It is not clear how many of the men who have been killed were civilians or fighting for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. US President Joe Biden and the Israelis do not trust the ministry figures. But in past conflicts, Palestinian casualty statistics have been considered accurate by international organisations. ", "One grim milestone is fast approaching. The United Nations (UN) says around 9,700 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 21 months ago.", "Some of the Palestinian dead would have been part of Hamas. But even if that proportion is as high as 10%, which is unlikely, it means that Israel is on course to have killed as many Palestinian civilians in just over a month as Russia has killed in Ukraine since February 2022. (The UN says its data for Ukraine is incomplete and the true number of civilians killed is likely higher, while in Gaza the number of dead is also likely to be higher as many Palestinians are believed to be buried under rubble).", "The UN human rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that the attacks are disproportionate and could be war crimes.", "From the first days after the Hamas attacks, President Biden has supported Israel's decision to use military force to remove Hamas from power. But he has also added the qualification that it needed to be done \"the right way\". He meant that Israel should observe the laws of war that protect civilians. ", "The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv. Before he took off, he said: \"When I see a Palestinian child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child from Israel or anywhere else.\" ", "I have reported on all of Israel's wars in the last 30 years. I do not remember a US administration stating so publicly that Israel needs to observe the laws of war. Blinken's visit suggests that he believes Israel is not following Biden's advice. ", "Something else we know for certain is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under great pressure. ", "Unlike Israel's security and military chiefs, he has not accepted any personal responsibility for the catastrophic series of failures that left Israeli border communities virtually undefended on 7 October. ", "Last Sunday, 29 October, he caused uproar when he sent out a tweet blaming the intelligence agencies. Mr Netanyahu deleted the message and apologised.  ", "Three Israelis, a former peace negotiator, the ex-head of the Shin Bet (Israel's internal intelligence agency) and a tech entrepreneur, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs saying that Mr Netanyahu should not have any part of the war and whatever follows. The Israeli PM has loyal supporters, but he has lost the confidence of prominent figures in Israel's military and security establishment. ", "Noam Tibon, the retired general who fought his way into kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his family, compares Mr Netanyahu to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who was forced to resign in 1940, and replaced by Winston Churchill. ", "Tibon told me: \"This is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel. It was a military failure. It was an intelligence failure. And it was the failure of the government\u2026 the one really in charge - and all the blame is on him - is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2026 He is in charge of the biggest failure in the history of Israel.\"", "It is also clear that the old status quo has been smashed. It was unpleasant and dangerous, but it seemed to have a certain grimly-familiar stability. Since the end of the last Palestinian uprising around 2005 a pattern has emerged that Mr Netanyahu believed could be sustained indefinitely. That was a dangerous illusion, for all concerned - Palestinians as well as Israelis. ", "The argument went that the Palestinians were no longer a threat to Israel. Instead, they were a problem to be managed. The tools available include sticks, carrots and the ancient tactic of \"divide and rule\". ", "Mr Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for most of the time since 2009 - after an earlier spell between 1996 and 1999 - has argued consistently that Israel does not have a partner for peace. ", "Potentially, it did. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the main rival to Hamas, is a deeply flawed organisation, and many who support it believe its aged President Mahmoud Abbas needs to step aside. But it accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel back in the 1990s. ", "\"Divide and rule\" for Mr Netanyahu meant allowing Hamas to build its power in Gaza at the expense of the PA. ", "While Israel's longest-serving prime minister is always careful about what he says in public, his actions over many years show that he does not want to allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. That would involve giving up land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Israeli right wing believes belongs to the Jews. ", "From time to time, Mr Netanyahu's pronouncements would leak. In 2019, a number of Israeli sources say that he told a group of his Likud members of parliament that if they opposed a Palestinian state they should support schemes to pump money - mostly provided by Qatar - into Gaza. He told them that deepening the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank would make it impossible to establish a state. ", "It is also clear that Israel, backed by the Americans, will not tolerate a deal that allows Hamas to stay in power. That guarantees a lot more bloodshed. It also raises big questions about what or who replaces them, which so far have not been answered. ", "The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea has lasted for more than 100 years. One lesson of its long and bloody history is that there will never be a military solution. ", "In the 1990s, the Oslo peace process was established to try to end the conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem alongside Israel. The last attempt to revive it, after years of on-off negotiations, happened during the Obama administration. It failed a decade ago, and since then the conflict has been allowed to fester. ", "As President Biden and many others have said, the only possible chance for avoiding more wars is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side.  Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, would do all they could to scupper the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. Some of them believe they are following the will of God, which makes it impossible to persuade them to accept a secular compromise. ", "But if this war does not deliver enough of a shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars.

", "The next day was much calmer.  A few weeks later the routines of the conflict were re-established. Benjamin Netanyahu, and his allies in the Trump administration, were able to congratulate themselves that the Palestinians had been contained.

", "Benjamin Netanyahu's decision - supported by the Americans - to allow the conflict to fester, in the mistaken belief that Israel could keep a lid on it while attending to more important matters, turned out to be a strategic error of monumental proportions. ", "I walked up the stone staircase to the office of Sabri Saidam in Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank. He was educated at Imperial College, London, is an adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas and is a senior member of Fatah, the faction once led by Yasser Arafat that dominates the Palestine Liberation Organisation. ", "Mr Abbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which was created in the Oslo peace process of the 1990s as a government in the making for an independent state. Now it is at best a job creation scheme with municipal functions, at worst a symbol of inefficiency and corruption. Abbas has not put himself up for re-election since 2006.", "Sabri Saidam said they had warned the Americans over Benjamin Netanyahu's belief that he could manage the Palestinians while trying, with American help, to normalise relations with the rich Gulf Arab oil monarchies.    ", "\"A reaction was coming. It was in the pipeline. Nobody knew what was the scale and the shape of it. But we have told the Americans many times in meetings that the Palestinians would react and don't leave matters hanging in the balance. You have to intervene.

That is the \"two-state solution\" that President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries who have been here in the last few weeks have said once again is the only realistic solution. ", "The trouble with that is that there is no peace process - the Americans last tried, and failed, to revive it ten years ago under President Barack Obama - and the two-state solution has become an empty slogan. ", "I went to see the former Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his glass-walled office in a tower in Tel Aviv. In 1973, as a young special forces commander, he planned and led an audacious raid on Lebanon, which they called Operation Spring of Youth.

Thousands of soldiers in combat gear have sealed off Palestinian villages, set up roadblocks and are protecting Jewish settlements, which are regarded as illegal under international law although Israel disputes this. ", "In an isolated settler outpost on a desolate hilltop outside Hebron, hard line Jewish nationalists carrying weapons told me they were waiting for the chance to use them against Palestinians. Their leader Meir Simcha, who walked round the outpost armed with a large machete in a leather scabbard, said that unlike other Israelis they had not been surprised by the Hamas assault on 7 October. It was a shame, he said, that so many Jews had to die to show mainstream Israel something he believed was self-evident.", "\"In a war you have a gun and a trigger,\" Simcha said. \"And for those who don't understand yet, we are at war. A war where the other side shows no mercy and we need to do the same. There's no choice.\" ", "Further north in the West Bank, the atmosphere in Jalazone refugee camp, just outside Ramallah, was sombre, fearful and angry, as two young men killed in an Israeli army arrest operation were buried. Mustapha al-Ayan - cousin of Mahmoud Seif, one of the dead men who was shot as he threw stones at the Israelis - said the army had not come to arrest suspects but to punish them for what Hamas did on 7 October.

So now they are attacking the people in the West Bank. God give mercy to all the martyrs in Gaza and the West Bank.\" ", "One fear often expressed by Palestinians is that Israel, in its rage, is using the crisis to try to inflict another Nakba, or catastrophe, on the scale of 1948. The evidence they cite is the way that more than a million Gazans have been forced to flee to the south of the Strip, and the threats made by some Israeli politicians to make Gaza smaller by taking tranches of land to use as buffer zones. ", "In Ramallah, Sabri Saidam, the Fatah official, talked about a map that Mr Netanyahu produced at the United Nations in September, showing an Israel that included the West Bank and Gaza.", "\"Everybody has in mind that the very map that Netanyahu carried before the nations at the General Assembly of the UN, in which there was no West Bank and Gaza. So the feel and general mood is actually entertaining the thought that Netanyahu is going after the deportation, the displacement of Palestinians leading up to the annexation of Gaza.\" ", "The ghosts of the past shape the mood on both sides. For Israel it is the Holocaust of European Jews at the hands of Nazi Germany. The massacres on 7 October have been called the worst day for the Jews since the Holocaust. The word \"selection\", that was used to describe the way Jews arriving at death camps were either sent straight to the gas chambers or spared to be worked to death, has been applied to suggestions that deals might be done that release foreign hostages before Israelis.
