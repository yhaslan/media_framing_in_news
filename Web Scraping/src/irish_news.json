These contributions will be invaluable in helping them to qualify for the contributory state pension, which must be applied for.", "Even though carers throughout the country provide long-term care with love, compassion and considerable self-sacrifice, they were thus far denied a contributory state pension. This commendable provision in the Budget is wonderful news for those who feared being left without an independent income in their golden years on the grounds that they had not paid PRSI on their meagre carer\u2019s allowance.", "Carers are angels of mercy who do their loved ones a noble service. They are shining examples of the goodness and the generosity of spirit that permeates Irish society. It isn\u2019t an act of charity to pay carers a contributory state pension. Rather, it\u2019s an act of social justice.", "Carers make their contribution through their selfless dedication to those in need. They more than earn their contributory state pensions. Well done to the Government for recognising that fact, however belatedly.", "Sir \u2014 There was a time when local councils were responsible for building houses, collecting rubbish, repairing roads and fixing leaking water pipes.", "We now appear to have an increasing list of actions they are unable to complete due to lack of financial and human resources.", "The blame for the councils\u2019 inaction is usually passed back to central government, and that can then be quickly matched by a similar list of incomplete issues that central government blames on them.", "We can see that local property tax (adjusted for equalisation), rents, rates and parking charges are some of the main income streams for local councils. In the case of rents and rates, collection levels appear to vary from council to council.", "Surely, in advance of the council elections next June, voters are entitled to ask what the local council priorities are and if their resources match?", "In the absence of any clear answers, maybe we could also ask candidates for the next general election to tell us what they think.", "Sir \u2014 The drama has ended for the season, with Ryan Tubridy being written out of the script.

That the vast majority of civilians of any nationality are the same: they are just trying to live their lives as best they can, within the confines of the environment they find themselves in, and they feel trapped by forces that are much bigger than them.
